# REWRITE-PLAN — rung ladder, gates, port manifest

Source of truth for order and doneness. Derived from SPEC §24,
`ebp/BUILDING-COMPANION.md`, and the poc-v1 divergence map
(`../llm-poc/docs/AUDIT-ebp2-divergence-map.md`). One rung per PR-sized
unit; a rung lands only with its exit gate green.

## Ladder

| Rung | Deliverable | Exit gate |
|---|---|---|
| **W0 contract wiring** | Vocabulary generation from `ebp/contract.json` (elisp tables + Kotlin codegen when the companion lands); drift round-trip | Generated vocabulary == contract, byte-stable |
| **W1 elisp wire core** *(started)* | `emacs/ebp.el`: §6 framing codec, §7 envelope, §4.1 duplicate rejection, §9 HMAC + proofs + token/nonce grammar, handshake message builders/verifiers, §10 client state skeleton | ERT green on: §9.3 KAT; every `ebp/goldens/wire/` fixture decoded at 1/7/whole-octet chunkings with manifest-expected outcomes; encoder byte-syntax incl. non-ASCII length |
| **W2 companion wire core** | Kotlin twin of W1 (FrameCodec largely ports; auth/envelope rebuilt) | Same fixture suite from Kotlin; hand-played handshake Emacs↔device completes |
| **W3 session lifecycle** | CONNECTED→CHALLENGED→SYNCING→READY both sides; welcome (profiles, floors, tombstones, limits, `input_state`); §10.3 barrier; `session.ready`; reconnection | Pre-auth fail-closed vectors (§24.6 items 4–5); barrier ordering test; welcome reservation inequality checked |
| **W4 surfaces** | `surface.update`/`remove` as requests; revisions + tombstones; snapshot store; `reset_input_ids`; §13.6 draft reconciliation; Core Node Set rendering (companion) / push path (client) | Applied/stale idempotency tests; update/remove/update race (§24.6 item 7); unknown-node/key degrade (§16.2–16.3); elisp text on phone |
| **W5 actions + events** | ActionDescriptors incl. `capture_fields`; `event.action` request protocol with EventId, 4-status results, Emacs receipt store; `state.changed` with barrier rules (§14.6) | Counter round trip; duplicate-after-restart (§24.6 item 9); state-before-action flush test |
| **W6 durability** | Companion durable queue (`queue_seq`, expiry high-water mark, dedupe transaction); `queue.replay` pump; safe admission | Kill matrix (§24.6 item 8); replay interruption/capacity (item 10); offline draft + sync + replay (item 11) |
| **W7 modules, by need** | dialogs (request + builtins), toasts, pie menus, themes, reminders, editor sync (new method layer over ported splice math), capabilities, triggers (§21.1 state carry-over, §21.2 transaction) | Each module's REQUIRED rules + its §24.6 module cases; password exclusion (item 12) |
| **W8 durable-offline conformance** | Hoist reminders/triggers to durable file backing shared across connections; device-lifetime `TriggerFiringService`; §21.2 durable transaction + pending-local recovery; boot re-arm; reminder tap routing; engine P2 sweep (validateAction delegation, identifier caps, notification state gate). Closes the W7 audit's P1 cluster — see docs/W8-durable-offline-plan.md | JVM: fire-with-no-engine admits durably; throttle/receipts survive restart; device matrix: at-most-once across force-stop, offline fire → replay on connect, reboot re-arm |
| **W9 organ ports** *(done 2026-07-23)* | Port-safe modules from poc-v1 (see manifest) with format-6 vocabulary updates, driven as atoms a–m (wire completeness → renderer skeleton → content/input/layout/viz families → builtins/multi-view → scaffold → theme+syntax → editor toolbar §17.7 → image guard stack → notification meta/actions → parity gate). All 39 node types render; the app profile advertises exactly what the flat `when(type)` dispatch renders (NodeSupportPinTest). See docs/W9-feature-parity.md | **MET**: every node vector in `ebp/goldens/widgets.golden` renders through a live session (`test/smoke-parity.el`: 61/61 applied); the pin test keeps advertisement == dispatch; 233 wire + 18 app + 26 elisp green + per-family device smokes |
| **W10 overload + polish** *(done 2026-07-26)* | §22 traffic classes, bounded processing, `log.error` protocol. Companion half was discharged in Tier-2 (LD-13 hysteresis + #106 pump exemption); W10 proper is the EMACS half — sender ceiling (512/128 twin, local synthetic 1401, `queue.replay` exempt), inbound bound under the A8 §1.5 invariant (pause never inside a send; every send resumes reading first; backlog measured in the timer-hosted parsed queue), exhaustion = one `log.error` 1401 + close (backlog or #124 dispatch-depth trigger), plus the A8 H2 pre-send-claim fix on `edit.apply`. Amendments #124-125. See docs/W10-overload-plan.md | **MET**: §24.6 item 14 per class in the wire suite over the live loopback — intent flood (400 `state.changed`, complete/ordered/exactly-once), ordered-stream flood (200 deltas, no invented resync), sender ceiling refuse/recover/exempt/close-fails-locally, pause/resume + in-send guard against a real stopped process, both exhaustion triggers observed as `log.error 1401` at the peer then close. 45 wire-elisp / 250 elisp total green |

Interleave W2 with W4/W5 client work as device access allows; the ladder
orders gates, not calendar.

## Historical reuse assessment (from the divergence map)

This assessment records the expected adaptation risk when it was written; it
is not an allowlist. Code from any POC may be copied, cherry-picked, merged,
ported, or adapted. Reused code must be audited against the current normative
EBP specification and current architecture. If desired protocol behavior is
not normatively defined, amend the specification and align its contract
projection, goldens, and affected conformance tests before relying on it.

**Lower-risk Kotlin reuse candidates:** all `Sdui*.kt` renderers, `ThemeBridge`,
`SyntaxHighlight`, `IconMap`, `RadialMenu`, `ReorderableList`,
`NotificationRenderer`, widget/tile chrome, `EmacsWaker`,
`DeviceCapabilities` (unwrap results), app module. **Keep-logic:**
`EditorSync` splice/UTF-16 math + `applyExternal` gates, `InboundPipeline`
concept, `TriggerHost` gate/interpolation logic, `StateSampler`,
`CalendarTriggers`.

**Lower-risk Elisp reuse candidates:** every ABOVE-BOUNDARY module (org layer,
files, shell, demo, settings, apps, satellites) and WIRE-ADJACENT builders
(widgets, hypertext, buffer, keymap, sections, results, tablist, spec, source,
async, comint); `jetpacs-lint` re-pointed at format 6; `build-contract` /
`build-bundle` pattern retained.

**Higher-risk reuse candidates:** poc-v1 `jetpacs.el` transport/auth,
`jetpacs-sync.el` message layer, `jetpacs-minibuffer.el` dialog layer,
`jetpacs-complete.el` direction, Kotlin `JetpacsAuth`,
`JetpacsConnection`, `ActionReceiver`/queue schema, `JetpacsDialogState`,
`EditorSync` message layer. Their older designs were expected to require more
adaptation at the protocol boundary; this classification does not prohibit
reusing any part of them.

## Spec-feedback loop

Implementation friction lands in the W-register (divergence map §5) or as
new findings; each resolves as an `ebp/` amendment before the dependent
code lands. Open at start: W3 (toolbar `line_ops` — needed before W8 ports
orgseq toolbars), W1 (`theme.set.base` — before W8 ports the theme
picker), W6 (`tile:*` namespace — before W8 ports tile slots).

Resolved: ebp amendment #33 (2026-07-22) pinned local-editing efficiency —
delta coalescing before `seq` assignment and source-throttled carets are
explicitly conformant; the W7 editor module builds on that reading.

## The ebp.el boundary (the jsonrpc.el model)

**Decided 2026-07-22:** `emacs/ebp.el` is *the Emacs implementation of the
EBP spec* — the analogue of jsonrpc.el to JSON-RPC — and Jetpacs is an
application built on it. Same split the Kotlin side already has with
`companion/wire`. The line is SPEC §24.2: ebp.el owns every duty the spec
assigns to "a conforming EBP 2 Emacs endpoint"; Jetpacs owns everything
above the semantic-action boundary.

| ebp.el (the endpoint) | jetpacs (the application) |
|---|---|
| Framing, envelope, auth, session lifecycle, reconnection | Widget/surface DSL and builders |
| Surface push plumbing: revisions, tombstone absorption, applied/stale results | What the surfaces contain; org layer, apps, shell |
| `event.action` server: allowlist registry, EventId receipt store, 4-status results | The registered handlers' behavior |
| `state.changed` reconciliation, `input_state` merge, draft rules | What to do with the values |
| Module method plumbing (dialogs, editor sync, triggers, capabilities) | Dialog content, editor commands, trigger policy |

The registry *mechanism* is ebp.el; the registered *content* is Jetpacs.

Enforcement, in-tree (physical extraction is a U-phase `git mv`, not now):
`ebp-` namespace only; **zero `jetpacs-` dependencies, ever**; its own
conformance suite pinned to the `ebp/` corpus; and the delineation guard —
`test/run-tests.sh` batch-loads `ebp.el` alone and fails if any
`jetpacs-`-prefixed symbol exists afterward.

## Code conventions

- **elisp floor: Emacs 30.1** (Jetpacs requires Emacs on the device, and
  the on-device build is 30.1). Every library declares
  `Package-Requires: ((emacs "30.1"))`; modern stdlib is assumed —
  no compat shims.
- **`setopt` for user options** (Emacs 29+): any code, example, or doc
  that sets a `defcustom` uses `setopt` so custom setters run. `setq`
  remains correct for internal variables and lexical state — do not
  blanket-replace it.
- `lexical-binding: t` everywhere. **The Emacs endpoint rents core
  `jsonrpc.el` unmodified** for transport, framing, and id bookkeeping
  (decision log #2, ebp amendment #34); the strict reference decoder in
  ebp.el serves conformance suites and future non-jsonrpc transports, not
  the live path. Beyond core libraries, wire modules stay dependency-free.
- **The rental rule** (from the jsonrpc.el correction, applied broadly):
  rent a core built-in wherever its contract matches a spec duty;
  hand-roll only where the spec demands behavior the library lacks; no
  non-core dependencies in the protocol library. Rented so far: native
  JSON, jsonrpc.el, secure-hash, base64, timer.el, **sqlite.el** (the
  receipt store; file fallback when `sqlite-available-p` is nil — VERIFY
  on the on-device Android Emacs), **custom.el** (defgroup `ebp`; user
  options overridable from init.el with `setopt`, per-connection config
  still wins). Earmarked: `auth-source` for pairing tokens (SPEC 9.1) at
  the pairing rung; `tabulated-list`/`hierarchy` for devtools buffers;
  capf (not completion.el) when the editor module serves `edit.complete`.

## Standing product decisions

**orgseq editing tier (decided 2026-07-22):** orgseq block editing uses the
**local-editor tier** — `editor` without `document`, `publish_state: true`,
drafts + `on_save`/`capture_fields` — so editing works offline and rides
§13.6 draft reconciliation and the welcome `input_state`. Synchronized
editors (`document`, SPEC §19) are reserved for live buffer-mirroring
surfaces and are read-only off-`READY` by spec; orgseq MUST NOT depend on
them for block text entry.
