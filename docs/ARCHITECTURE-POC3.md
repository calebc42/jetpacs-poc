# POC 3 target architecture

The canonical cross-platform implementation sequence is
[`PLAN-poc3-rebuild.md`](PLAN-poc3-rebuild.md). The detailed Android store is
specified by [`PLAN-room3-rebuild.md`](PLAN-room3-rebuild.md), and required
platform primitives are pinned in
[`PLATFORM-RENTAL-REGISTER.md`](PLATFORM-RENTAL-REGISTER.md). Together they
supersede the original fork-forward cache adapter and the historical lock-hoist
KMP runbook.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

EBP is Jetpacs-agnostic. Its Emacs implementation uses built-in Emacs
facilities. In this tree, `:ebp-kmp` contains the storage-neutral KMP
durable-store SPI, reducers, and rollback-capable memory reference
implementation. `:wire` retains transport, framing, and protocol code and
depends on `:ebp-kmp`. Neither module may depend on Jetpacs packages, Room,
Navigation, Compose, Android, or Jetpacs cache policy.

The same boundary governs the elisp tree, and there it is carried by the file
and symbol prefix. The rule is ratified (bed8ef4, `refactor(complete):
ebp-complete - the capf bridge is wire and Emacs only`):

> `jetpacs-` names what cannot exist without Kotlin, Android, and Compose;
> `ebp-` names what only ever touches the wire and Emacs.

The boundary test for a module is its contract, not its subject matter: a
contract phrased in the node/surface vocabulary is Compose-shaped and takes
`jetpacs-`; a contract phrased in wire methods and Emacs state takes `ebp-`.
The prefix is an enforced claim rather than a label. An `ebp-` file must load
alone in a bare `emacs -Q --batch` with only this tree on the load path, and
its require closure must be vanilla Emacs plus other `ebp-` files — no Jetpacs
feature, and nothing Jetpacs-flavored left behind: no function, variable, face,
error condition, group documentation, or `:group 'jetpacs` parent link. The
delineation guard in `test/run-tests.sh` proves exactly that, one process per
file, over the `emacs/ebp*.el` glob rather than a hand-kept list, so a file
making the claim is guarded the day it lands.

Jetpacs is one implementation of EBP. The long-term product target is the
Compose Catalog authored in Emacs/Elisp and transferred as EBP documents. The
Android app is a dumb renderer: it selects a document from Jetpacs' durable Room
implementation of accepted EBP state, renders it, and returns typed EBP
actions. It must not compile a second Kotlin copy of the catalog.

Jetpacs is coupled to EBP semantics and, on Android, to ordinary Compose—not
to Material. The eight-node EBP Core Node Set has a Foundation-only reference
renderer. Design-system-specific semantics live in positively negotiated
renderer extensions, so a different design system can implement the same core
without importing Material or emulating Material-only controls.

The reference Companion composes two downstream design implementations:
`:renderer:material3` for Glasspane and `:renderer:jetpacs` for Jetpacs'
emerging component language. Glasspane and its Material 3 Catalog explicitly
require `glasspane.material3`; the separate Jetpacs Components catalog requires
`jetpacs.components`. Their schemas and golden witnesses live in
`renderer-extensions/`, outside EBP. EBP 3 carries only positive target
profiles; Jetpacs dual-gates each extension node on its advertised node name
and the app's declared extension requirement. A receiver never implies support
from a prefix, and an unavailable app remains outside its builders and gets an
explanatory Apps screen. This keeps Jetpacs' Compose-shaped foundation reusable
while letting Glasspane remain deliberately and faithfully Material 3.

`jetpacs.scope` is the app-only, invisible selection boundary for Jetpacs core
presentation. Compose extension-node ownership remains singular; a separate
composition-root registry may replace only types in the generated canonical
EBP node schema, keyed by a positively admitted renderer-extension ID. It never
admits a downstream extension-owned node, including `jetpacs.scope`, and each
registered renderer may decline an individual canonical node before the
dispatcher takes its normal fallback. Scoped selection never changes node
validation or target profiles, and roots discard inherited scope. The current
registrations replace canonical `text_input` and local canonical `editor`
presentation inside app-authored `jetpacs.scope`. An editor carrying `document`
declines the Phase 4 override and therefore continues through Glasspane
Material until synchronized Jetpacs editing lands in Phase 5. Dialogs do not
admit the app scope, and every canonical control outside it also continues
through Glasspane Material.

The Material renderer's version is pinned by
`companion/gradle/libs.versions.toml`'s `material3` entry. The catalog's
`jetpacs-m3-material-version` constant restates that value so the device can
identify the implementation it demonstrates; the catalog suite reads the
version catalog and fails if those two values diverge.

Durable delivery crosses two independent failure domains. Jetpacs commits
outgoing events to a Room 3 transactional outbox. Emacs commits received
EventIds plus recoverable application work to its own `ebp-sqlite.el` inbox
before returning `accepted`. The sender's Room database is never the receiver's
acceptance evidence.

Room 3 and Navigation 3 are Jetpacs choices, not EBP requirements. The EBP spec
must permit their use without naming or requiring them.

Implementation and backend contracts prove the observable behavior first.
After those gates are green, audit mismatches against the current EBP spec:
change the implementation when it is out of spec, or expand the spec only when
the missing requirement can be stated without a language, platform, database,
UI toolkit, or product dependency.

## Module map

| Module | Responsibility | May depend on |
|---|---|---|
| `:ebp-kmp` | Storage-neutral durable-store SPI, reducers, and rollback-capable memory reference implementation | Kotlin, serialization |
| `:wire` | Transport, framing, EBP vocabulary, generic injected renderer-admission seam, and protocol handling/state | `:ebp-kmp`, Kotlin, serialization, coroutines, platform transport abstractions only |
| `:core:model` | Jetpacs read models and identifiers | Kotlin |
| `:core:database` | Complete Room 3 schema, DAOs, builders, migrations, and exported schemas | Room 3, SQLite |
| `:core:ebp-store` | Jetpacs Room implementation of the storage-independent EBP transaction SPI | `:ebp-kmp`, `:core:database` |
| `:core:data` | Read-only Room `Flow` projections for Jetpacs UI state | `:core:model`, `:core:database` |
| `:core:navigation` | Serializable Nav 3 destination keys | Nav 3 |
| `:core:testing` | Shared read-model fakes and backend contract fixtures | `:core:data`, `:core:model` |
| `:renderer:model` | Toolkit-neutral renderer contribution/profile registry, shared raw-EBP JSON readers, semantic projection, action/editor hosts, and editing transport models | `:wire`, serialization, coroutines; no Compose or design-system dependency |
| `:renderer:compose` | Foundation-only reference renderer, generic semantics mapping, and shared state-based text-input/editor controllers | `:renderer:model`, Compose Foundation/UI; no Material or Styles |
| `:renderer:material3` | Glasspane Material 3 extension, rich app presentation, theme projection, custom Styles components, and visual/accessibility tests | `:renderer:compose`, Material 3, adaptive Compose, experimental Foundation Styles |
| `:renderer:jetpacs` | Jetpacs-owned Foundation components, private theme tokens, Styles, generated `jetpacs.components` vocabulary, and visual/accessibility tests | `:renderer:compose`, Compose Foundation/UI, experimental Foundation Styles; no Material |
| `:renderer:glance` (later) | Restricted widget renderer/profile | `:renderer:model`, Glance |
| `:feature:pairing`, `:feature:surface`, `:feature:settings` | ViewModels, entry providers, and Jetpacs feature UI | Jetpacs `:core:*` modules |
| `:app` | Single Android composition root, transport/platform adapters, shell/navigation, and exact composition of installed renderer implementations | `:wire`, `:renderer:material3`, `:renderer:jetpacs`, Jetpacs core/feature modules |

The present split is intentional: `:wire` consumes `:ebp-kmp` for portable
durability behavior, while `:core:ebp-store` supplies Jetpacs' Room-backed
implementation. A future publication boundary should preserve these APIs and
must not pull Jetpacs choices into EBP.

## Room 3 durable-state contract

Room is Jetpacs' sole durable implementation of information accepted from
Emacs, not an authority beside Emacs and not a second projection beside POC 2
files. Storage-independent acceptance rules remain `:ebp-kmp` reducer
behavior; the Room adapter supplies their atomic persistence.

Room also owns the Companion's durable outbound event queue. It does not own
the Emacs-side EventId receipt/work commitment: that is an independent local
SQLite inbox controlled by the receiving endpoint. Loss of Jetpacs or its
session must not erase Emacs' accepted-event evidence.

- Every durable record derived from Emacs is partitioned by pairing identity.
- Room stores surfaces/tombstones/stale metadata/current views, input drafts,
  queue counters/events/clock state, reminders/receipts, trigger
  registrations/runtime, themes, import state, and revocation cleanup state.
- Surface acceptance, draft reconciliation, queue dedupe/counter admission,
  reminder receipt handling, trigger runtime plus event admission, and pairing
  revocation use explicit Room transactions.
- No result is reported as accepted and no platform effect runs before commit.
- DAO `Flow` values feed read-only repositories and ViewModels; composables do
  not query the protocol engine or write accepted state.
- Whole-database delete-and-replace refreshes and live Room/file dual-write are
  forbidden.
- Section 19 editor sessions, deltas, sequence counters, caret positions, and
  completion results are session-scoped and non-durable. They must not enter
  Room or the offline action queue.

POC 1 used Room for queued events and triggers only. POC 2 introduced richer
file-backed queue, surface/tombstone/draft, reminder, and trigger state. POC 3
ports that richer behavior into one normalized Room 3 store and fixes the
pairing, stale-state, commit-reporting, and cross-store transaction gaps rather
than returning to POC 1's smaller schema.

## Navigation 3 contract

Navigation keys are Jetpacs presentation state. They identify pairing,
catalog/surface, and settings destinations; they do not become EBP methods or
document fields. The initial keys are serializable so `rememberNavBackStack`
can own saved navigation state when the current activity is migrated.

The first app migration should follow the local `basicsaveable` recipe for one
back stack. Multiple stacks and adaptive scene strategies are later additions,
after the single-stack dumb renderer is correct.

The TODO app's full fake-network refresh is deliberately not adopted. EBP
already supplies ordered, revisioned mutations, so deleting all local rows and
repopulating them would waste bandwidth, erase revision floors, and weaken
ordering guarantees. Its Hilt setup is also not copied into this first
scaffold; the repository boundary permits adding the selected DI mechanism
after the pending rebase without changing cache semantics.

## Implementation sequence

### Historical Step 1 — preparatory scaffold and device proof

The original five-module scaffold, revision/tombstone prototype, rebase, Android
16 floor, Room KMP/device proof, CI gates, and toolchain verification are useful
preparatory evidence. They are not the final persistence architecture.

Run bundled-SQLite DAO and repository integration tests on the KMP JVM target.
Do not treat Android host tests as device coverage: the Android variant of the
bundled driver loads JNI from an Android package, and local Room 3 itself
disables `testAndroidHostTest` for its multiplatform suite. Prove the Android
boundary by compiling the Android KMP variants and assembling the app. The
device follow-up reused the same `commonTest` suite on connected Android
hardware and was verified on a Pixel Tablet running Android 17/API 37.

### Step 2 — clean Room-integrated rebuild

Recreate the Companion from the local architecture template, preserve POC 2
behavior as backend contracts, add the generic suspending transaction SPI and
serialized runtime actor, implement the complete normalized Room schema, and
port one durable vertical slice at a time. The final data path is:

```
:wire transport / framing / protocol
        -> :ebp-kmp reducer / transaction SPI
        -> :core:ebp-store Room transaction
        -> committed Room 3 state
        -> read-only repository Flow
        -> screen ViewModel StateFlow
        -> registry-derived target profile
        -> Compose Foundation core renderer
        -> app-composed design renderers (`:renderer:material3` and
           `:renderer:jetpacs` here)
```

The former typed post-accept cache callback is not a persistence seam. A
post-commit domain change may notify platform-effect adapters, but Room is
already committed before it exists. Move destination ownership to a saveable
Nav 3 back stack only after the Room store cutover. A catalog destination
selects a cached EBP surface; it does not define the catalog.

The complete work packages, schema, transaction matrix, import policy, and
cutover gates live in `PLAN-room3-rebuild.md`.

### Receiver component styling and accessibility

The experimental Compose Styles API is confined to downstream design-renderer
modules; it is neither a new EBP styling language nor a dependency of
`:renderer:compose`. In `:renderer:material3`, `EbpTheme` resolves the system or
authored EBP palette, derives private Material color roles from the 13 neutral
wire roles, installs `MaterialTheme`, and projects the same colors and shapes
through `ProvideJetpacsStyleTokens`. Only custom, receiver-owned components
consume its `JetpacsComponentStyles`; Material components continue to use
their supported parameters and Material tokens.

`:renderer:jetpacs` has an independent private theme derived from the same
neutral EBP roles and never reads or provides `MaterialTheme`. Its public
`JetpacsAction`, `JetpacsChoice`, `JetpacsPanel`, and state-based
`JetpacsTextField` and `JetpacsEditor` composables accept
`style: Style = Style`; Styles own visuals and ordinary modifiers own layout,
input, enabled state, focus, and semantics. Action, Choice, and field styles may
animate bounded interaction colors, while editor styles never animate caret,
selection, or text-layout state. The Action and Choice each expose one full-row
target, Panel labels are headings without merging their child tree, and each
field or editor retains one editable interaction owner while labels, affixes,
glyphs, and logical line numbers remain presentation-only.

Its `jetpacs.scope` renderer emits canonical children directly through the
shared dispatcher under the owning `jetpacs.components` scope. It creates no
layout, semantics, state, or interaction owner. The composition root resolves
canonical `text_input` to `JetpacsTextInputRenderer` and local canonical
`editor` to `JetpacsEditorRenderer` only in that subtree; Glasspane Material
dispatch continues outside it and for synchronized editors.

The existing Material gallery components deliberately exercise separate
contracts:

- `JetpacsCatalogAction` is one full-row button target used by the native app
  catalog.
- `JetpacsChoiceRow` is one full-row radio target; its Material `RadioButton`
  glyph has no callback, so accessibility services never encounter duplicate
  controls for one setting.

Text-editing behavior is not Material-owned. `:renderer:model` defines the
toolkit-neutral action/state and synchronized-editor hosts and carries input
display epochs, editor mirrors, completion offers, raw annotations, and exact
Unicode-scalar/UTF-16 conversions. `:renderer:compose` owns the state-based
`TextInputController` and `EditorController`; downstream renderers supply only
their field decoration, palette, typography, annotations, completion popup,
and toolbar presentation. Both Glasspane's Material field and Jetpacs'
Foundation field consume the same `TextInputController` and toolkit-neutral
presentation binding. The Jetpacs mapping adds only its compact work surface,
private palette, code-native decoration glyphs, selection colors, and
syntax-role palette. The local `JetpacsEditor` consumes the same shared
`EditorController` through the shared presentation binding, adding a
Foundation work surface, syntax projection, shared-scroll logical line gutter,
and local toolbar presentation without importing Material. Nodes carrying a
synchronized `document` deliberately retain the Material fallback until the
existing neutral editor host is connected in Phase 5.

Action handoff and admission are distinct. A renderer synchronously learns
whether the app host accepted an occurrence into the ordinary confirmation,
capture, and dispatch path. Every handed-off occurrence then receives exactly
one terminal callback on the Android main thread. Only a committed durable
queue record or a live `accepted`/`duplicate` result is safe remote admission;
receiver-local builtins complete under a separate local outcome, while local,
queue, storage, transport, and peer refusals remain explicit failures. Normal
`clear_on_submit` waits for safe admission and is guarded against a later edit.
Passwords never enter accepted draft state, `state.changed`, saved Compose
state, or logs; the owning occurrence captures the volatile value, and every
terminal result or presentation disposal erases it. Remote editor mirror
adoption bypasses the local change path and cannot echo a delta. Local editors
publish drafts only when `publish_state` is authored and are bounded by
`max_field_bytes`; synchronized documents use the independent
`max_editor_bytes` limit. Both limits count JCS-encoded text at the controller
boundary.

Generic accessibility is not Material-owned. `:renderer:model` consumes the
contract-generated §16.5.1 schema and node defaults, resolves accessible names
in the order `semantics.name`, `content_description`, textual `label`, icon
name, node type, then `node`, and derives roles and state only from existing
Node members. `:renderer:compose` maps that projection through Compose
Foundation. Both the Foundation renderer and Glasspane Material renderer use
the same additive modifier; it never clears or merges children.

The projection is attached to the bounds that own the interaction. Inner
glyphs remain decorative, a control retains one click target, section headers
are headings, progress and collapsibles expose their derived state, and
labeled swipe sides become custom accessibility actions. Authored custom
actions call `RenderCtx.action`, so dialog rebinding, confirmation, durable
admission, offline policy, capture fields, and result handling are identical
to a visible action. Compose reports success after that ordinary-path handoff,
not after a remote completion. Chrome places its existing screen title in
`pane_title`; this changes announcements only and has no layout or styling
effect.

Both design renderers' component galleries and their screenshot and
device-semantics envelopes are recorded in
[`companion/TESTING.md`](../companion/TESTING.md). Screenshot references are
deterministic renderer fixtures; real-device tests remain required for focus,
accessibility services, input, persistence, reconnect, and navigation.

Before adapter work, run a local-source best-practices audit and make its
findings an explicit gate:

- Gradle wrapper, AGP, Kotlin, KSP, and Compose compiler compatibility,
  including a verified distribution checksum for the selected wrapper.
- Android 16/API 36 and 36.1 behavior changes, lifecycle, background work,
  permissions, edge-to-edge, security, accessibility, and adaptive layouts.
- Current Android Jetpack guidance for repository/state-holder boundaries,
  lifecycle-aware collection, testing, and dependency injection.
- Compose Multiplatform source-set ownership, immutable/stable UI state,
  saveable state, semantics, performance, and platform adapters.
- Room 3 schema export and migrations, constructor/driver configuration,
  transaction boundaries, coroutine contexts, DAO Flow behavior, and tests.
- Nav 3 saveable back stacks, entry decorators, modular entry providers,
  predictive back, deep links, scenes, and adaptive layouts.
- Emacs 30+ built-ins, especially `jsonrpc.el` and `track-changes.el`, with
  ERT coverage on the minimum supported 30.1 release and current Emacs.
- EBP conformance against local EBP `slop-fork/main`, keeping both
  `:ebp-kmp` and `ebp.el` independent of Jetpacs.

Treat every compiler deprecation warning as an audit input. The first green
Android build already identifies inherited renderer/wire cleanup candidates:
AutoMirrored icons, positional `rememberSaveable`, dynamic swipe anchors,
primary/secondary tab rows, and Kotlin 2.4 exhaustiveness.

### Step 2.5 — harden the workspace before the synchronization engine

Pause feature work after the Room cutover and renderer connection. Refine the
evidence-backed hardening backlog before changing `ebp-sync.el` or its
`track-changes.el` engine:

- Inventory Kotlin and Elisp code smells, duplicated behavior, oversized
  files, leaky boundaries, and missing characterization tests. Classify each
  extraction as Jetpacs app code, reusable `:ebp-kmp`, upstreamable `ebp.el`,
  or workspace-only tooling; do not move product policy into EBP.
- Inventory existing utilities, reference material, generators, and lookup
  assets, especially `docs/lookup-tables`, vocabulary generators, goldens,
  validation scripts, and device helpers. Prefer extending one authoritative
  utility over introducing parallel helpers or hand-maintained tables.
- Diff the rebased m3-fidelity implementation and its tests against the DSL
  core. Identify missing or inconsistent primitives for structure, modifiers,
  state, actions, theming, adaptive behavior, accessibility, and expressive
  components; distinguish EBP vocabulary gaps from renderer-only defects.
- Build a POC 1 versus POC 2 regression and pattern matrix covering behavior,
  performance, persistence, synchronization, tests, and developer workflows.
  Mark each item restore, improve, replace with a built-in, or intentionally
  retire, including the former `jetpacs-sync.el` behavior now planned as
  generic `ebp-sync.el`.
- Propose developer-experience tools where they remove repeated reasoning:
  one-command local gates, schema/vocabulary drift checks, lookup-table
  generation, golden refresh/verification, module-boundary lint, device
  selection, fixture builders, and concise machine-readable audit reports.

Land only low-risk cleanup needed to make Step 3 legible. Larger abstractions
require at least two demonstrated consumers or a measured duplication/problem,
plus characterization coverage that proves behavior before and after the move.

### Step 3 — restore synchronization as generic `ebp-sync.el`

Port the behavior of POC 1's `emacs/jetpacs-sync.el`, but name the upstreamable
module `ebp-sync.el` and keep every symbol and dependency Jetpacs-agnostic.
Require built-in `jsonrpc.el` through the EBP transport and built-in
`track-changes.el`; do not hand-roll either subsystem.

For each authorized synchronized buffer:

1. Keep a buffer-local tracker ID, EBP session, sequence, and exact shadow.
   Register with `track-changes-register` using the default deferred signal,
   not `:immediate`, so JSON encoding and transport never run inside low-level
   change hooks.
2. Use a signal accepting an optional disjoint-distance argument. Register with
   `:disjoint t` and, on that special callback, call
   `track-changes-fetch` before returning. The fetch callback may copy and
   enqueue data but must not modify the buffer, block, encode JSON, or perform
   I/O. This prevents two far-apart edits from being widened into one large
   replacement solely for bookkeeping.
3. For the normal deferred callback, call `track-changes-fetch`. Its
   `(beg end before)` tuple already coalesces a command's nearby low-level
   mutations. Build one queued `edit.apply` splice from zero-based scalar
   `start = beg - 1`, `del = scalar_length(before)`, and the current
   `buffer-substring-no-properties` for `beg..end`. Advance a session only
   after the Companion accepts that exact next sequence.
4. Serialize queued applies: only one operation may contend for `seq + 1`.
   A short bounded queue preserves Section 19 ordering while command-level
   coalescing reduces frames and `:disjoint t` avoids oversized unrelated
   regions.
5. Treat `before == 'error`, `track-changes-inconsistent-state-p`, a shadow
   mismatch, or a typed stale result as a resynchronization boundary. Never
   guess a splice or send a blind whole-document replacement.
6. When applying a remote `edit.delta`, use one atomic buffer change while
   honoring write protection. Immediately consume that known self-change with
   public `track-changes-fetch` and an ignore callback so it is not echoed
   back; then update the session shadow and sequence.
7. Validate that the entire document and splice strings are losslessly
   representable as Unicode scalar values before exposing synchronization.
   Emacs positions can be used directly only after that eligibility check.
8. Call `track-changes-unregister` on close, document change, identity change,
   mode disable, and buffer death. Transport loss closes the EBP session even
   if the Emacs buffer survives.

This transfers incremental text only after edits, combines noisy low-level
changes at command granularity, and preserves small independent splices. Full
text remains limited to `edit.open` and explicit `edit.resync` recovery.

### Step 4 — feature modules and Compose Catalog parity

Introduce feature modules only as screens become real: pairing, surface,
settings, and an isolated renderer test app. Use ViewModels that combine
repository `Flow` values into immutable `StateFlow` UI state, following the
local TODO sample. Recreate each Compose Catalog example in Elisp/EBP and test
the dumb renderer against it before adding another example.

Glance remains a later Jetpacs renderer profile. It consumes the same cached
Room state through the renderer-model seam, stores widget-instance configuration
separately, and routes actions through the Room outbox. It is advertised only
after its restricted handler registry passes device tests. Quick Settings stays
a separate `TileService` projection.
