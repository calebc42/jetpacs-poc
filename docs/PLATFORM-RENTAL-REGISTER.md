# Platform-rental register

Status: mandatory implementation gate. This is a current ownership register,
not a dated dependency-version ledger; exact versions live in their owning
version catalogs.

This register records the platform/library primitive that owns each common
subsystem. Before adding a helper, adapter, macro, or compatibility layer,
check this table and demonstrate the missing behavior with a test. A private
API or locally reimplemented subsystem is permitted only behind a narrow,
documented compatibility boundary with an upstream/removal plan.

## Emacs 30.1+ endpoint

| Concern | Authority to rent | POC 3 rule |
|---|---|---|
| JSON-RPC transport, framing, request IDs, dispatch | built-in `jsonrpc.el` | Use public classes/generics/functions. Do not depend on `jsonrpc--*`, predicted IDs, private process filters, timer queue representation, or global `timer-list`. Upstream a missing seam. |
| Durable local records | built-in `sqlite.el` and SQLite subrs | `ebp-sqlite.el` owns schema and checked transactions. No append-only receipt fallback may return conforming `accepted`. Check `sqlite-open` and commit results explicitly. |
| Buffer change capture | built-in `track-changes.el` | `ebp-sync.el` registers deferred trackers, fetches changes outside low-level mutation work, uses `:disjoint t`, and unregisters every lifecycle path. |
| Canonical buffer initialization | `normal-mode`, normal file/local/dir-local/project hooks | One normally initialized visited buffer per document. No hand-selected `auto-mode-alist` shadow environment. |
| Atomic buffer edits | `atomic-change-group`, `replace-region-contents` | Use for rollback/full reseed. Do not mistake buffer atomicity for a disk/SQLite transaction. |
| Save/revert lifecycle | normal visited-buffer save/revert functions and hooks | Do not bypass mode save hooks or defer an accepted durable effect without a recoverable work record. |
| Org search | built-in `org-search-view` and `org-tags-view` | Project their results through one bounded neutral adapter. Applets may choose presentation and modes, but must not ship a parallel index or query engine. |
| Org document presentation | `jetpacs-org-render` neutral model plus scoped host presenters | Reuse the renderer for content. Register link presentation per buffer and surface, and clear that context when an applet unloads; no global presenter takeover. |
| Applet file mutations | `jetpacs-files-create`, `jetpacs-files-rename`, `jetpacs-files-move`, `jetpacs-files-trash` | Reuse the Files allowlist and literal-entry guards. Never overwrite on create/move, follow a symlink out of policy, or silently replace recoverable trash with deletion. |
| External file observation | `file-notify-add-watch`, save/revert hooks | Timer polling is a bounded fallback only when notifications are unavailable. |
| HMAC | `gnutls-hash-mac` | Pass an intentional disposable key copy because the primitive wipes directly supplied key strings. No pure-Elisp HMAC in production. |
| Secure entropy | `iv-auto` | Fail closed when unavailable. Do not shell to `head` or assume `/dev/urandom`. |
| Credential lookup/deletion | `auth-source` provider injected into EBP | EBP stays storage-agnostic. Jetpacs policy selects the backend and forget-pairing deletes through it. |
| Completion | public completion metadata/boundary/all-completions APIs | Do not call `completion--*`. |
| Eglot/Flymake | public Eglot and Flymake APIs on the canonical buffer | Do not call `eglot--*`; upstream a missing headless/observation seam. |
| Command execution | `command-execute` and standard command predicates | Do not reproduce command loop semantics with a direct `call-interactively` wrapper. |
| Active keymaps | `current-active-maps` | Do not reconstruct precedence manually. |
| Images | Emacs image type/size/metadata APIs | Do not maintain separate PNG/JPEG header parsers. |

Minimum-version rule: run the public Emacs modules on both Emacs 30.1 and the
current local Emacs checkout. Current-only convenience APIs require an isolated
version adapter and a 30.1 test.

## Android and AndroidX

| Concern | Authority to rent | POC 3 rule |
|---|---|---|
| Durable Jetpacs application state | Room 3 KMP | One pairing-partitioned Room store; explicit transactions, schema export, migrations, reopen/device/fault tests. UI never writes protocol state. |
| Outgoing durable delivery | Room 3 transactional outbox | Stable EventId, sequence, payload, expiry/dedupe/capacity/runtime updates commit before first send. Delete only after a permanent peer disposition. |
| Secrets | Android Keystore-backed credential adapter | Tokens and reusable encryption keys do not enter Room or logs. Use separate aliases for authentication and sensitive queued payloads. |
| Preferences | DataStore when a general settings store is needed; current Room `app_runtime` for the bridge switch | User/product preferences are not pairing-authored protocol state. The current user-enabled bridge policy is a device-local singleton, never pairing data. |
| Long-lived runtime ownership | Android service plus structured coroutines | `Application` is composition root only. Reader, bounded actor, writer, and reconciliation scopes have explicit owners and cancellation. Android 14/API 34 is the floor; the user-enabled `specialUse` FGS remains best effort and its notification is not liveness evidence. |
| Serialized mutation ordering | `Channel<Command>` coroutine actor | Do not port POC 2 synchronized monitors/executors or invent `WireLock`. No transaction or actor command waits for socket/platform work. |
| Deferrable retryable work | WorkManager | Use for reconciliation/cleanup/update work, not the live socket or exact-time alarms. |
| Exact scheduling | AlarmManager with capability checks | Commit registration/receipt first, invoke platform API afterward, and reconcile on boot/permission changes. |
| Lifecycle UI collection | ViewModel `StateFlow`, lifecycle-aware Compose collection | Follow local architecture-samples state-holder/repository pattern. No process-global raw `JsonObject` UI flows. |
| Navigation | Navigation 3 local recipes | `rememberNavBackStack`, saveable state and ViewModel decorators, identifiers-only `NavKey`, predictive-back/device tests. Do not copy the template's custom unmanaged Navigator. |
| Text editing | state-based Compose text fields, `InputTransformation`, `TextFieldBuffer.changes` | Convert real IME/paste/accessibility transactions to EBP splices. Do not diff whole old/new strings after every edit. |
| Permission results | Activity Result APIs | Do not hand-roll request-code or callback ownership. |
| Images/network/cache | Coil 3 with a secured Ktor/OkHttp fetch path | Preserve EBP DNS/SSRF/redirect/size/format constraints in a custom fetcher/interceptor. Do not maintain a raw HTTP/TLS/chunk/LRU stack. |
| App widgets | Glance with the implemented widget renderer profile | Read accepted Room projections, update explicitly, keep host-instance binding separate, and route actions through the Room outbox. Advertise only implemented widget handlers. |
| Quick Settings | `TileService` | Separate renderer/projection; do not force it through Glance. |
| Accessibility/adaptive UI | Compose semantics and current adaptive components | Treat semantics, large screens, keyboard, contrast, and font scaling as renderer conformance gates. |

The local AndroidX checkout, local architecture-samples/templates, local
Nav 3 recipes, and local Compose/Glance samples are the implementation
references. Online examples are not substituted for a newer local checkout.

## Kotlin Multiplatform and protocol code

| Concern | Authority to rent | POC 3 rule |
|---|---|---|
| Structured concurrency | kotlinx.coroutines | Runtime receives a caller-owned scope; no `GlobalScope`, unmanaged `Job`, raw executor ownership, or blocking DAO adapter. |
| Data interchange | kotlinx.serialization plus EBP validation | Generate typed contract vocabulary/method/limit projections into `commonMain`. Raw open content remains validated EBP data, not platform objects. |
| Contract drift | `ebp/contract.json`, goldens, one generator pipeline | Generated Kotlin and Elisp are byte/diff checked. Do not maintain parallel lookup tables by hand. |
| Storage semantics | domain transaction SPI plus reference memory backend | `ebp-kmp` owns reducers/invariants; Room owns persistence mechanics. No DAO/entity types in the SPI. |
| Renderer capabilities | installed renderer registries | Derive per-target profiles from actual handlers. Compose, notification, and Glance profiles remain distinct. |
| Common-code purity | a real non-JVM compile target and import lint | A directory named `commonMain` is not proof. JVM file stores/crypto/time/DNS remain adapters. |

## Intentionally custom EBP behavior

The platform-rental rule does not mean deleting protocol semantics. These stay
custom, generated, or explicitly validated because the EBP specification owns
them:

- Companion-side strict framing/UTF-8/duplicate-member/depth/safe-number rules;
- EBP handshake, capability, method-direction, state-machine, revision,
  replay, trigger, and Section 19 semantics;
- canonical payload hashing and contract-specific validation;
- typed reducers and transaction laws;
- target/profile-aware surface normalization and unknown-node degradation; and
- scalar-index conversion and EBP sequence/shadow reconciliation.

The Emacs endpoint may delegate the receiver tolerances explicitly permitted by
the SPEC to built-in `jsonrpc.el`; the adversarial Companion still enforces the
required strict receiver boundary.

## Review checklist

For every new subsystem or dependency:

1. Identify its owning platform primitive in this register.
2. Cite the local source/sample and minimum supported version.
3. State the missing behavior that requires an adapter.
4. Keep the adapter narrower than the platform subsystem.
5. Add conformance, restart, failure, and boundary tests proportional to risk.
6. Record whether the code belongs to EBP, reusable `ebp-kmp`, Jetpacs,
   renderer infrastructure, or workspace-only tooling.
7. Re-run the whole-rebuild trigger test: source of truth, transaction owner,
   lifecycle owner, public seam, failure domain, renderer model, or KMP module.

If none changes, the work is an adapter/refactor and must not create a parallel
architecture.
