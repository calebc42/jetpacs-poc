# Chrome vocabulary and functional contracts — v4 (v1 ratified 2026-07-28; v2 ratified with the chrome-polish rescope; v3's two-pole section ratified 2026-08-14, the S7 seam; v4's full-bar form + drawer-injection rule ratified 2026-08-15, the PARA plan)

*v2 change: element names are now the **Material 3 component names**, 1:1
(m3.material.io; `material3` 1.4.0 per
`lookup-tables/M3-COMPONENT-LOOKUP.org`).  The functional contracts are
unchanged — they are the Emacs-side discipline M3 does not provide.  Scope:
the Jetpacs base layer — docstrings, user-facing docs, commit messages, and
the conventions base apps follow.  The EBP wire names (SPEC §17.6) are frozen
and are not renamed.  Tier-1 apps may deviate; the base does not — HOW an app may deviate is
now a contract of its own: see "The two integration poles" below.*

## The three name layers

| Layer | Names | Owned by |
|---|---|---|
| Wire | `top_bar` `bottom_bar` `fab` `floating_toolbar` `drawer` (scaffold slots) | SPEC §17.6 — frozen |
| Elisp API | `jetpacs-chrome-screen` keywords, `jetpacs-chrome-dock-items-function` (and the raw-node `jetpacs-chrome-dock-function`) | base — stable |
| Vocabulary | the M3 component names below | this document |

1:1 holds at the vocabulary layer ONLY.  The wire layer is deliberately not
1:1 (the lookup table's own note: `scaffold` bundles 8+ composables;
`OutlinedTextField` serves two wire types) and the contracts are Jetpacs',
not Material's.  A convention here is a *naming and placement* rule, never a
capability rule: chrome is structural content with no hidden behavior
(SPEC §17.6), and every chrome affordance maps to a command reachable
without it (M-x parity, JA-3).  Chrome is a projection of commands.

## The vocabulary (1:1 with M3)

| Element | M3 name | Wire slot | Retired names |
|---|---|---|---|
| slide-in panel behind the hamburger | **Navigation drawer** ("drawer" in running text) | `scaffold.drawer` | App Menu, hamburger menu |
| bar across the top | **Top app bar** ("top bar") | `scaffold.top_bar` | Menu bar, Contextual Actions Bar |
| docked bottom bar of destinations | **Navigation bar** | `scaffold.bottom_bar` (via the dock seam) | View switcher, Bottom nav bar |
| start-edge column of destinations on a wide window | **Navigation rail** | `scaffold.rail` (the same dock seam, medium width and up) | — |
| floating cluster of contextual actions | **Toolbar — floating** | `scaffold.floating_toolbar` | Contextual Actions Bar |
| bottom-anchored row of actions | **Toolbar — docked** | `scaffold.bottom_bar` holding actions | — |
| round primary-action button | **FAB** | `scaffold.fab` | — |
| any `more_vert`-anchored menu | **Menu** (the pattern: **overflow menu**) | `menu` node | Action menu, kebab menu |

## Per-element contract (unchanged from v1 except as keyed)

**Navigation drawer** — app-level *destinations* (screens, roots, the
launcher rows), never actions that mutate a document.  Everything in it is
reachable elsewhere (M-x parity).  Fewer than three destinations: no drawer.
The composed host drawer is injected into the stack-BOTTOM scaffold ONLY —
the root wears the hamburger and a drilled screen wears the back arrow (the
M3 top-level rule); a guest screen, never the bottom, can never wear the
host's drawer; a screen that authors its own `drawer` slot wins
(single-slot authored-wins).  The v4 ratification of the S8 rule.

**Top app bar** — identity and globals: title, back affordance or drawer
button on the left, at most two or three screen-scope action icons on the
right (M-x sits top-right), plus at most one overflow menu.  It never
changes contents in response to a selection (that is the floating toolbar's
job).

**Navigation bar / navigation rail** — three to five *destinations*, the
selected one always indicated; items are places, never actions.  In Jetpacs
the places are the `multi_view`/`view.switched` machinery, and the
destinations persist across every screen via the dock seam — a navigation
bar that vanishes on drill is a defect, not a style.  Author the
destinations as data with `jetpacs-chrome-dock-items-function` and chrome
wears them per SPEC 20.1.1: a real M3 navigation bar on a compact
window (either axis compact — a phone in any orientation; the
catalog-proven item composition: icon above label, the
secondary-container active indicator, 80dp container), a start-edge
navigation rail (`scaffold.rail`) on medium and expanded windows — the
M3 NavigationSuiteScaffold behavior, one authoring.  The raw-node
`jetpacs-chrome-dock-function` remains as an override for a hand-built bar
(always `bottom_bar`, never adaptive), and wins when both are set.

**Toolbar** — *actions*, in two variants exactly as M3 draws them:
**floating** (the `floating_toolbar` slot) for mode- or selection-contextual
actions keyed to the buffer (the org toolbar is the archetype); **docked**
(action nodes in `bottom_bar`) when a screen needs bottom-anchored actions.
A screen shows a navigation bar or a docked toolbar, never both, and a
toolbar never duplicates the top app bar's globals.

**FAB** — exactly one, verb-shaped, the screen's single primary *creation*
action.  Never a menu, never a toggle; no natural creation act, no FAB.

**Menu** — anchored to `more_vert`, scoped to its anchor: on the top app
bar it is the overflow menu (screen-scope actions that did not earn an
icon); on a row or card it holds that item's actions.  Destructive entries
sit last and carry `:confirm`.

## The two integration poles (v3 — the S7 ratification)

An app relates to the shell's chrome at one of two poles, and both are
legitimate.  The pole names below are the vocabulary the scaffold
seams (the debt-and-scaffold plan's S1–S6) implement; where a
mechanism has not landed yet it is keyed to its seam, so this section
ratifies NAMES and CONTRACTS without overclaiming capability.

**Build-within** — the app composes INTO the shell and its surfaces
read as Jetpacs screens.  This is the DEFAULT pole: today the shell
dock already persists into every app unless a screen authors its own
slot, and defapp/drawer/theming/resume all compose.  What the pole
grows into: the app CONTRIBUTES destinations to the host hub through
the defapp registry (S1 — the poc-1 `:views` mechanism restored;
llm-poc/emacs/core/jetpacs-apps.el:88 is the reference); the dock can
go APP-PRIMARY — core remains intact and the app's own destinations fill
the remaining M3 3–5 budget — or, with `:dock-core nil`, core contributes
none and the app's destinations fill the budget whole. With
`:drawer-core`, the app declares which suppressed core destinations
relocate to the navigation drawer and must explicitly account for every
other suppressed destination through an app destination that subsumes it
(M-x parity is the floor, not the bar) (S2); shell
globals (M-x) persist into the app's top bar (S3); and a screen pushed
onto a FOREIGN stack is a sanctioned GUEST — scoped event delegation,
prefixed ids, foreign-stack teardown — never an `:any-surface` workaround
(S4).  Glasspane is the exemplar.

**Standalone** — the app rejects the shell's chrome and reads as its
own application.  Declared, not improvised: `jetpacs-defapp
:chrome 'standalone` (S5) withdraws the core dock items and the
global-actions injection for the app's surfaces; the app authors its
chrome whole.  An orgzly-native or the orgseq line is the exemplar.
The ratified injection rule S5 implements: a screen that authors ANY
dock slot opts out of dock injection on EVERY slot — bar and rail
alike (the current plist-member guard tests only the slot the dock
chose, which leaks an injected rail over an authored bottom bar on
medium and expanded windows; that is a defect against THIS sentence).

**What standalone does NOT reject.**  Rejection is presentation-only;
the platform invariants are not optional at either pole:

- the BACK contract — every pushed screen participates in the stack
  and the system back gesture;
- ERROR ISOLATION — a failing screen or seam builder costs its own
  screen or section, never the surface;
- the PUSH BUDGET and reconciliation discipline — standalone chrome
  ships through the same node vocabulary, byte accounting, and
  key-based reconciliation as everything else;
- M-x PARITY — every affordance in standalone chrome still projects a
  command reachable without it.

**What neither pole can promise today** (Companion-tier, recorded so
the poles are honest): one Android activity and task for every app;
`theme.set` is session-global, so an app restyling itself restyles
the shell (the Jetpacs ef-themes picker does this NOW — build-within
behavior whether intended or not); one screen, last-push-wins; and
per-app Android identity (launcher shortcuts, share intake) does not
exist.  A standalone-feeling app still shares the one window.

## Fidelity gaps the lookup table exposes (future work, not renames)

- **NavigationBar is unwrapped**: today's navigation bar is authored
  `button` nodes in the `bottom_bar` slot — the contract is honored but the
  visuals are approximated.  Wrapping the real composable (a `nav_bar` wire
  type or the lookup's suggestion of a smarter `bottom_bar` renderer) buys
  the authentic icon-above-label items and indicator pill.  SPEC-governed
  expansion: contract.json, constructor, renderer, NodeSupport, goldens.
- **ListItem is unwrapped**: `jetpacs-chrome-row` is the manual
  card/row/column composition of exactly that component.
- **FloatingToolbar (material3 1.5+)**: the `floating_toolbar` slot
  predates the real composable; adopting it when the dependency moves is
  the same kind of upgrade.

## Rationale

M3 names are what the platform documentation, the Compose API, and every
Android reference use — a private synonym ("View switcher", "Action menu")
taxes every future doc lookup.  The v1 rejections stand for the same
reason: "Menu bar" collides with Emacs's menu bar, "Contextual Actions Bar"
with Android's contextual action bar, "App Menu" with both.  What Jetpacs
adds is not names but contracts — the placement rules and the M-x-parity
discipline above — and those survive v2 untouched.
