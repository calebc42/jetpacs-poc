/**
 * The `view.switch` descriptor of VIEW's chrome back arrow, or null when this
 * screen has none — the stack bottom, a non-scaffold root, or a top bar whose
 * leading slot is something else. Null means the system default proceeds and
 * the Activity finishes, which is the pre-S11 behavior for every screen.
 *
 * VIEW is the RESOLVED current view (MaterialRendererBridge.resolveView collapses the
 * stack's multi_view before publishing), so "this screen's back arrow" is
 * unambiguous — the views below it are not in this tree at all.
 *
 * The match is deliberately narrow, because whatever this returns HIJACKS the
 * system back gesture. Only the top bar's LEADING spine is considered, so a
 * drawer row, a body button, or a trailing bar action carrying `view.switch`
 * can never claim back — they switch views on tap and must keep doing only
 * that. The spine descends first-children through the plain containers because
 * a bar is authored either as the icon row itself (jetpacs-chrome-screen) or
 * as a box that row fills (the m3 catalog's center-aligned bar, whose title is
 * centered OVER the icons).
 *
 * A `view.switch` naming no view is refused: CompanionEngine.executeBuiltin
 * drops it, and an ENABLED handler that does nothing is strictly worse than
 * the system default it displaced.
