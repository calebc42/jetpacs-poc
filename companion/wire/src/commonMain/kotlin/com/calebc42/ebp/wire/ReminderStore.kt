     * `at_ms` as a Long across every NUMERIC spelling — the fired receipt key
     * is built from this, so the reader keeps org.json `getLong`'s tolerance
     * for integer and integral-double literals. It does NOT keep that method's
     * JSON-STRING coercion (`"5000"` no longer reads as 5000): dropping the
     * coercion is the module-wide policy stated in JsonAccess.kt, and
     * acceptance already refuses a non-numeric `at_ms`, so only a hand-edited
     * store file could hold one.
     *
     * Deliberately NOT [wireIntOrNull]: an integral double IS an accepted at_ms
     * (acceptance checks integrality by VALUE), so `5000.0` reaches this store
     * as a binary64 and a legacy file may hold one. A reader that refused it,
     * or that keyed on the literal "5000.0", would compute a DIFFERENT key than
     * the pre-swap build did for the same reminder and re-present one that had
     * already fired — SPEC 18.6's at-most-once, broken by a respelling. Pinned
     * by PersistenceCompatTest.reminderWithIntegralDoubleAtMsLoadsAsLong.
     *
     * The fractional fallback keeps org.json's truncation toward zero. Such a
     * value can only reach the store past validation (`at_ms: 1.5` is refused
     * at accept), but a store file that holds one must keep keying the way it
     * used to, not start throwing out of a platform alarm receiver.
