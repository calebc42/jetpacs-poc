// The device-lifetime trigger firing service (SPEC 21.2). Owns the one
// TriggerRuntime + the durable TriggerStore + a reference to the durable
// queue, so firing works with NO live session: device sources feed
// observations here regardless of a socket, and an admitted occurrence's
// durable half (throttle/records + queued event) commits without a connection
// — the next session's replay delivers it. A live engine registers itself as
// the LiveSession (newest-wins slot) for live drop delivery and the wake/pump
// after a durable admit.
//
// Concurrency: public methods run the runtime under THIS monitor, collecting
// the live-session calls, and invoke them only AFTER the monitor is released.
// So the service never calls a LiveSession (engine monitor) while holding its
// own lock — the strict order is engine -> service -> queue, and DurableQueue
// is an internally-synchronized leaf.
