/**
 * SPEC 19.3 (amendment #172, R5): one editor's one-outstanding
 * candidate-documentation request slot, latest-wins.
 *
 * The SPEC's SHOULD — at most one `edit.candidate.doc` outstanding per
 * session — meets a user who drags a highlight across rows faster than
 * round trips conclude: a new (epoch, index) wanted while one is in
 * flight OVERWRITES the previously desired pair rather than queueing
 * behind it, and the desired request is issued at the in-flight one's
 * conclusion.
 *
 * [retire] (the offer died) drops only the DESIRED pair: the
 * outstanding flight stays, because it is physically on the wire and
 * its conclusion is guaranteed exactly once (the engine's sendRequest
 * answers locally when it refuses) — keeping it in the slot is what
 * makes a long-press on the FRESH offer queue behind it instead of
 * double-issuing (the R5 review's one-outstanding hole).  A flight the
 * engine refused to send never concludes on its own; the caller
 * concludes it immediately.
 *
 * Tickets pair each conclusion with the exact flight it ends.  With
 * the bridge concluding on the instance a flight was ISSUED from (an
 * R5 review fix — tickets are per-instance, so re-resolving the slot
 * by key let a discarded instance's stale conclusion disown a fresh
 * instance's first flight), the check guards the remaining shapes: a
 * double conclusion, and a conclusion outliving a [forgetEditor]
 * removal onto an orphaned instance.
 *
 * Extracted as a pure class because DeviceBridge is constructor-coupled
 * to android.content.Context and has no unit test: every slot-state
 * mutant (stale publish, dropped reissue, never-freed slot) would
 * otherwise be unkillable (R5 review F18).  Thread-safe: the request
 * path runs on the bridge's dispatch executor, conclusions on the
 * engine's reader thread.
