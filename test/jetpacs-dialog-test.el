;;; jetpacs-dialog-test.el --- JC-4a prompt floor exit gate -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The JC-4a exit gate (docs/PLAN-jetpacs-consumers.md, JC-4 section).
;; Every test drives the REAL advice through a stubbed
;; `ebp-client-dialog-show', so what is under test is the whole path a
;; prompt takes: gate -> spec build -> SPEC 18.1 advertisement check ->
;; conclusion decoding.  The stub captures the spec, so the assertions
;; are about the actual wire shape, not about a mock's shape.
