;;; smoke-chrome.el --- W9-g: §17.6 scaffold chrome -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Push a full scaffold (top_bar, body, fab, bottom_bar, floating_toolbar,
;; drawer, on_refresh). The adb driver taps the fab, opens the drawer and taps
;; its item, and pulls to refresh. PASS = the surface applies and every
;; landed gesture dispatched its action (refresh only via the user gesture).
