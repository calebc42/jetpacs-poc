;;; ebp-org-test.el --- JA-4 exit gate: the org engine -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The JA-4 exit gate (docs/PLAN-jetpacs-apps.md JA-4) plus the biting
;; regressions for the twelve poc defects fixed at the port.  Fixtures
;; are temp .org files (the hypertext-test shape) with
;; `ebp-org-roots' let-bound to the temp directory — resolve-ref's
;; root allowlist refuses everything else by design, so EVERY test that
;; resolves goes through `ebp-org-test--with-fixture'.
;;
;; This process loads NO application layer, and asserts it below.  That
;; is the placement rule for the pure block of run-tests.sh (the
;; ebp-complete precedent), and here it is also the claim under test:
;; the engine earned the `ebp-' prefix by needing nothing above it, so
;; a suite that reached for one jetpacs symbol would be reporting a
;; boundary breach as a passing test.

  "Run BODY under the floor's D2 no-prompts regime, reproduced HERE.
The dispatch extent binds `inhibit-interaction' and stubs the readers
that ignore it; several tests below pin what the engine's own clamp
does INSIDE that regime — that a would-be question becomes an
`ebp-org-refused' status rather than a raw `inhibited-interaction' or a
hang.  The regime is therefore an INPUT to these tests, and the suite
builds its own: requiring the floor to obtain it would make the engine
suite load the application layer, which is the one thing this file is
not allowed to do.  The reader list mirrors `jetpacs--blocking-readers'
\(jetpacs-surfaces.el), where its per-name justification lives; if that
list grows, this copy is deliberately allowed to lag — it is a fixture,
not a second guard."
