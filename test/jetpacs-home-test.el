;; SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later

;; jetpacs-init.el is package composition, but its screen
;; builders are code, and a builder that signals renders the chrome
;; error screen on the tablet ("Screen home failed to build").  This
;; suite extracts the hub defuns from the composition file WITHOUT loading it
;; (the complete package dials the Companion) and builds the
;; home screen in every state.  Both bugs this harness caught on day
;; one (:pad vs :padding; :key passed as a card member) would have
;; shipped silently under the module-only suites.
