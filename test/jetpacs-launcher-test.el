;;; jetpacs-launcher-test.el --- JA-6 launcher exit gate -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The launcher half of the JA-6 F5 gate: the registry read (self
;; excluded, sorted), the row shape, the open verb's membership
;; stale-guard (the wire does not get to nominate surfaces), and the
;; show verb's :any-surface exemption through the REAL dispatch.
