;;; jetpacs-buffer-test.el --- JC-1 Tier-0 renderer exit gate -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The JC-1 exit gate (docs/PLAN-jetpacs-consumers.md): a fontified
;; fixture renders to a byte-asserted golden (test/goldens/renderers.golden
;; — regenerate by evaluating `jetpacs-buffer-test--write-golden' after a
;; reviewed rendering change); the tree passes the reference profile; the
;; welcome span/byte budgets truncate rather than over-emit (plan 2.5-5);
;; and the two tap actions honor decision D2 (status now, effect deferred).
