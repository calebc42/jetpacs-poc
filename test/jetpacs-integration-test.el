;;; jetpacs-integration-test.el --- cross-module seam wiring -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The suite that loads the application layer TOGETHER.
;;
;; Every other elisp suite runs in its own batch Emacs with a minimal
;; `require' set, which is what keeps them fast and independent — and is
;; also, per AUDIT-ja1-ja2 section 3(h), the structural reason the harness
;; is blind to a whole class of defect: a seam that only exists when two
;; modules are both loaded is tested by NO process.  The drill seam is the
;; live example.  `jetpacs-chrome' publishes itself as the navigator's
;; drill host from a `with-eval-after-load', and every navigate test binds
;; `jetpacs-navigate-drill-function' to a stub — so the entire drill
;; feature can be deleted and CI stays green.
;;
;; This file's rule: require the real modules, stub nothing that the seam
;; runs through, and assert the wiring that only exists between them.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'ebp)
(require 'jetpacs-widgets)
(require 'jetpacs-async)
(require 'jetpacs-surfaces)
(require 'jetpacs-shell)
(require 'jetpacs-buffer)
(require 'jetpacs-device)
;; The org ADAPTER, for the reset registration it carries: `ebp-org.el'
;; may not name a floor symbol, so its reset reaches
;; `jetpacs-reset-functions' through this shim or not at all — and only
;; a process that has both the floor and the shim can see that.
(require 'jetpacs-org)
;; Order matters and is the point: chrome's `with-eval-after-load' fires
;; when navigate arrives.  Requiring chrome FIRST exercises the backfill
;; branch, which is the one no other suite reaches.
(require 'jetpacs-chrome)
(require 'jetpacs-navigate)
;; Required LAST on purpose: theme subscribes to `jetpacs-ready-functions'
;; at depth -50 after the shell (90) and chrome (default) are already on
;; it, so the ordering assertions below exercise the late-loader case —
;; `add-hook' re-sorts by depth on every add, in either load order.
