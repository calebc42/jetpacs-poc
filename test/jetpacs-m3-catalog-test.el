;;; jetpacs-m3-catalog-test.el --- the M3 catalog exit gate -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The catalog is 41 components and 279 example screens of authored
;; nodes; nothing else in the tree exercises that much of the builder
;; surface at once.  This suite is the gate: it BUILDS every screen the
;; app can show (Home, 41 component screens, 279 example screens, the
;; theme screen), serializes each through the canonical serializer, and
;; checks the SPEC rules a live push would check -- §16.2 profile,
;; §16.1 document-unique ids -- offline, with no device.
;;
;; It also holds the FIDELITY line: the inventory must still be the
;; upstream inventory (41 components in upstream order, each with its
;; upstream example count), and no example may still carry the
;; generator's triage sentinel.  A component module that quietly drops
;; an example fails here.
