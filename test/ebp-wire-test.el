;;; ebp-wire-test.el --- W1 conformance suite for ebp.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Driven by the ebp submodule's conformance corpus (SPEC 24.5-24.6):
;; - the 9.3 HMAC known-answer vector, recomputed from scratch;
;; - every goldens/wire fixture decoded at whole/1-octet/7-octet chunk
;;   sizes with the manifest's expected outcome (positive fixtures must
;;   yield the expected messages; negative fixtures the expected error);
;; - encoder byte syntax, including the UTF-8 byte-count rule;
;; - envelope classification and handshake params against contract.json.

delegation clause — in which case a duplicate-member or over-deep body it
handed to a host library is silently accepted instead of refused, and the
manifest's expectation is unproducible.  This endpoint does NOT elect it:
`ebp-make-decoder' is our own framing and JSON-model receiver, not
jsonrpc.el's, so we are held to the Companion-strength expectation on every
