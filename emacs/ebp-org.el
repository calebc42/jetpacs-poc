;;; Commentary:

;; The org engine, under the prefix that names what it is.  `ebp-' by
;; the rule ratified 2026-08-06 (bed8ef4, `refactor(complete):
;; ebp-complete - the capf bridge is wire and Emacs only'):
;;
;;     `jetpacs-' names what cannot exist without Kotlin, Android, and
;;     Compose; `ebp-' names what only ever touches the wire and Emacs.
;;
;; The engine passes the boundary test with nothing left over.  org is
;; built-in Emacs; a query is a sexp and a heading is a buffer position;
;; the refusal vocabulary below is SPEC 14.4/14.5 wire.  Nothing here
;; builds a node, names a surface, or knows that a phone exists.  The
;; prefix is an ENFORCED claim rather than a spelling convention:
;; test/run-tests.sh loads every `emacs/ebp*.el' file alone, in a
;; process of its own, and fails if a `jetpacs' symbol — function,
;; variable, face, error condition, group, or loaded feature — exists
;; afterwards.
;;
;; The engine arrives in two rungs (docs/PLAN-ebp-org-split.md).  THIS
;; one carries the grammar and the primitives: everything that depends
;; on neither the root allowlist nor the cache and mutation blocks —
;; the three error conditions with their disposition map, the D2 IO
;; clamp, typed extraction, the wire-facing query parser and the one
;; interpreter it feeds, and the shared org primitives (timestamps,
;; headless capture, LOGBOOK, planning repeaters, TBLFM).  The
;; allowlist, the cache, refs, tokens, mutations, the outline model and
;; the reset follow at G7, when `jetpacs-org.el' shrinks to the
;; registration shim it exists to be.
;;
;; Ported from poc-v1's jetpacs-org.el engine ranges, NOT transliterated.
;; Two of the twelve fixed poc defects are load-bearing HERE and are
;; named at their fix sites; do not "restore" either from the source:
;;
;;   - `(read q)' on a wire string (obarray poisoning, measured; and an
;;     RCE hand-off when org-ql is installed).  The sexp arm reads under
;;     a throwaway obarray and vets against an allowlist (O2).
;;   - absolute paths in error messages: a condition raised here is
;;     answered toward the device, so it carries a bare reason symbol
;;     and never a path or a line of the user's own text (D-4, 23.3).
;;     Every condition this file signals carries no payload beyond its
;;     head symbol's own data discipline — there is no label, no
;;     formatting hook, and nothing for one to leak through.
;;
;; THE HANDLER STATUS BOUNDARY (SPEC 14.4/14.5).  The three conditions
;; are the whole of the engine's answer vocabulary and they map, via
;; `ebp-org-refusal-disposition', onto exactly the statuses a handler
;; may conclude with: `ebp-org-refused' -> `rejected';
;; `ebp-org-unresolved' -> `stale'; `ebp-org-unavailable' -> retry, the
;; one that is NOT a handler status but a `jetpacs-retry-later' call in
;; the application layer, so the durable record survives redelivery.
;; The split is load-bearing in one direction: `rejected' makes the
;; Companion DELETE the record, so a transient condition must never
;; land there.

Directory expansion therefore happens HERE, only after the raw-name
remote filter.  This mirrors Org's non-recursive `directory-files'

  "Vet, normalize and RE-HOME sexp query FORM in one schema-checked walk.

interned symbols of `ebp-org--wire-query-terms'; every string is a
FRESH propertyless copy no longer than `ebp-org--query-max-chars'
\(JA-4 audit P1-3 — the reader mints propertized strings from #(…) wire
text, with throwaway symbols riding in the property list); every other
atom is an integer or a canonical grammar literal (the comparators,
`today', the :on/:from/:to keywords); and every clause carries
schema-checked arity — so the throwaway-obarray symbols from
`ebp-org--read-query' die here and the interpreter fallthroughs are
internal invariants.  `quote' wrappers of the exact 2-element (quote X)
shape are unwrapped (the reader minted them from \\='(...) input; the
loose unwrap silently discarded trailing forms); bare symbols in string
position become fresh strings, exactly as the poc normalizer did.
Everything else — floats, vectors, records, byte-code objects (the
reader will happily mint one from #[...]), hash-table forms, stray
keywords, a wire `regexp' head — is refused outright.  Arity and type
violations refuse as \"Malformed HEAD clause\": the head symbol at
most, NEVER the query text (23.3), and cap violations never echo the
query either (it is user data)."

  "Non-nil when the entry read through accessor GET matches query TREE.
The ONE interpreter of the built-in grammar, and the engine's
extension point: TREE is a vetted query sexp, GET is an accessor that
reads whatever the caller's entries actually live in.  Base plugs in
the org entry at point (`ebp-org-entry-matches-p'); the vulpea
arm plugs in a note-index record; a test plugs in a plain closure over
an alist.  The grammar is shared, the accessor is the seam.

GET is called as (funcall GET WHAT &rest ARGS), with WHAT one of the
ten accessor questions:
  todo             the todo keyword string, or nil;
  done             non-nil when the entry sits in a done state;
  tags             the list of tag strings;
  priority         the priority CHARACTER (?A), or nil;
  title            the heading text, a string;
  level            the outline level, an integer;
  property NAME    the value of property NAME, or nil;
  planning WHICH   the raw stamp string for WHICH, \"SCHEDULED\" or
                   \"DEADLINE\";
  habit            non-nil when the entry is a habit;
  regexp-match RE  non-nil when RE matches the entry's text.
An accessor that answers nil for a question it cannot serve simply
never matches the terms built on it.

An accessor may APPROXIMATE, deliberately.  The vulpea arm's
`regexp-match' searches title + properties and not the body, because
the note index does not carry the body and visiting the file to be
exact would throw away the entire point of an index read.  An arm
advertises the coverage it does support by checking its accessor
against `ebp-org-note-query-terms'; the approximation is
documented AT the arm, never hidden inside it.

CALLERS MUST VET TREE FIRST, with `ebp-org-parse-query'.  This
function interprets; it does not validate.  An unvetted head falls
through to a plain `error' naming ONLY the head symbol — query
material is user data and never rides in an error.  That fallthrough
is deliberately NOT `ebp-org-refused': under SPEC 14.4 a refusal
is a durable answer ABOUT THE REQUEST, so routing a caller's
programming error through it would record a permanent verdict against
the user's query for a bug in the calling code."

value belongs, and BINDINGS maps each sentinel to its raw value for
`ebp-org--capture-restore' to install once expansion is over.

The values are deliberately NOT substituted here.  `org-capture' expands
whatever template it is handed, so a value pasted in beforehand is
indistinguishable from template the user wrote: `%(sexp)' in a phone
field would reach `org-eval', and `%[PATH]' would read a local file into
the user's org file (JA-4 audit P1-1, both reproduced).  There is no
escaping alternative — org-capture has NO literal-percent escape
\(verified against emacs-30.1 lisp/org/org-capture.el: every %% there is
inside a `format' string), and its expansion is a series of independent
regexp sweeps with no quoting syntax to hide behind.

A template DEFAULT is the user's own configuration, so it is substituted
directly and keeps org's semantics; only peer-supplied text is deferred.
