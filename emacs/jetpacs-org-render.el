;;; jetpacs-org-render.el --- Org buffer render skin (JA-5) -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The org analogue of the hypertext substrate: a Tier-1 skin registered
;; for org-mode buffers.  Deliberately flat and unopinionated — the body
;; IS the Tier-0 faithful line render (the user's font-lock faces, org's
;; own folding, tappable links, the caps), and only elements that have a
;; native SDUI node are upgraded in place:
;;
;;   -----                → a real divider
;;   | org | tables |     → the native table node (header rows, rules and
;;                          column alignment kept; table.el tables and
;;                          #+TBLFM stay text)
;;   [[file:img.png]]     → an image node for paragraphs that are exactly
;;   [[attachment:x.png]]   one image link — local files and Org attachments
;;                          ship as data: URIs through the root allowlist;
;;                          https URLs pass through for the device to fetch
;;   \begin{…}…\end{…}    → (JA-5c) the formula through org's own LaTeX
;;                          toolchain, compiled off the dispatch extent
;;   #+CAPTION: …         → a caption line under its upgraded element
;;
;; Most taps route through the Tier-0 span-action seam: item checkboxes
;; toggle (`jetpacs.org.checkbox'), and drawer and block header lines get
;; the fold affordance Tier-0's
;; outline-regexp detection cannot see (both reuse `jetpacs.buffer.fold'
;; — `org-cycle' at those lines toggles the drawer/block, verified
;; against emacs-30.1 org-cycle.el).  A heading line gets one structural
;; upgrade: tapping its readable text folds/unfolds it, while a trailing
;; more_vert icon opens the existing structured Org action sheet.  The
;; footnote/timestamp arms land with their dialog handlers (JA-5d/e), and
;; links follow through Org itself before the destination is offered to the
;; current document host.  A host can keep its own chrome and scroll or open
;; the destination there; otherwise the generic drill remains the fallback.
;; Everything else — citations, inline math, list markers, src blocks (which
;; org's native fontification already highlights) — renders exactly as the user's
;; font-lock shows it.  If anything in the upgrade pass fails, the
;; buffer falls back to the pure Tier-0 render: this skin can subtract
;; nothing.
;;
;; Budgets: the whole render runs inside ONE `jetpacs-buffer-with-budget'
;; (idempotent — it joins chrome's allowance when a multi_view build is
;; already holding one).  Tier-0 chunks spend spans/bytes themselves;
;; spliced native nodes are charged here — bytes via
;; `jetpacs-buffer-node-bytes', table cells via
;; `jetpacs-buffer-spend-limit' — because GATE 5 counts those aggregates
;; per SurfaceSpec and answers an overrun with a whole-push refusal.
;;
;; Exposure (SPEC 23.1): the buffer's records are superseded ONCE up
;; front, then every chunk and affordance accumulates into the same
;; document scope — so a native node emitted before the first Tier-0
;; chunk cannot have its records wiped by that chunk's supersession.
;; Span-minted taps carry `:args (:buffer NAME :pos POS)' and are
;; recorded by the deferred-exposure walk exactly when their node
;; survives both budgets.  The verbs here register OWNERLESS (the
;; `emacs.buffer.act' precedent): an org buffer renders on whatever
;; surface drills into it — files, the emacs-ui hub, habits — and an
;; owner-scoped registration would answer every foreign-surface tap
;; with a silent `rejected' (the JA-6 audit's dired-cards defect).
;;
;; The `:buffer' args member is the RAW buffer name, exactly as Tier-0
;; ships it for `emacs.buffer.act' — the exposure table and the handler
;; lookup key on the same string, so scrubbing here would break the
;; round trip while the generic verb still carried the raw form.

The reader collapses that run and replaces the full blank line following
a heading with a small spacer.  The ordinary Tier-1 renderer stays byte-

its document screen, top-bar actions, and FAB.  A host that enforces a
