;;; Commentary:

;; `ebp-' by the ratified rule (2026-08-06): `jetpacs-' is for what
;; cannot exist without Kotlin, Android, and Compose; `ebp-' is for what
;; only ever touches the wire and Emacs.  This file is the second kind
;; and always was — it requires `cl-lib' and nothing else, and its whole
;; contract is a SPEC 19.3 shape (`edit.complete' in, {label,
;; annotation?, insert?} out) harvested from Emacs's own capf machinery.
;; Not one node, builder, or surface appears below.  The prefix said
;; otherwise for a while; now it does not, and the delineation guard can
;; hold it to that.
;;
;; JC-5 of docs/PLAN-jetpacs-consumers.md: REBUILD the direction, PORT
;; the harvester.
;;
;; poc-v1 pointed this module the other way: `edit.complete' arrived as
;; a custom ACTION carrying its own text window and `request_id', the
;; answer left as a `completions.show' frame, and jetpacs-sync owned the
;; document shadow and its staleness.  Under SPEC 19.3 `edit.complete'
;; is a REQUEST the Companion sends and ebp.el answers: ebp owns the
;; document MIRROR, refuses a stale query `1201 editor-stale' before any
;; application code runs, and consults the client-wide
;; `:edit-complete-function' hook — (DOCUMENT EDITOR-ID TEXT CURSOR) ->
;; (PREFIX . CANDIDATES).  So the action handler, the reply frame, the
;; request ids, and the whole jetpacs-sync coupling are DELETED, not
;; ported; what survives is the pure-Emacs harvester underneath them.
;;
;; The harvest: replay the mirror TEXT into a hidden shadow buffer
;; carrying the document's major mode, run the buffer's own
;; `completion-at-point-functions' there, and return the completed
;; prefix plus candidate plists.  Corfu/company/posframe never enter the
;; picture: they are UIs over capf, and the device brings its own UI
;; (the RenderEditor dropdown JC-4b built).  Emacs is the completion
;; SERVER.
;;
;; The shadow never visits a file (no disk access, no LSP session, no
;; mode hooks — `delay-mode-hooks'), so a completion request cannot
;; mutate anything: `edit.complete' stays the pure query SPEC 19.3
;; makes it.  Matching the document id against `auto-mode-alist' is not
;; the interpretation SPEC 4.4 forbids — this side MINTED the id when it
;; pushed the editor node, so the match reads our own naming convention,
;; and nothing is ever opened by that name.
;;
;; Candidate shape (SPEC 19.3): each candidate is a CLOSED object
;; {label, annotation?, insert?, kind?} with `insert' defaulting to
;; `label'.  Closed is why the poc's `kind' member was DROPPED at the
;; rewrite — a conformant Companion must REJECT an unknown member — and
;; why amendment #169 brought it back FEATURE-GATED: `kind' is emitted
;; only for an editor whose author registered that the presenting
;; target advertises `editor.candidate_kind' (the sender-omit rule),
;; and only values from `ebp-complete-kind-vocabulary' ever cross.
;;
;; R0 of the completion ladder: the
;; shadow is not the only arm any more.  When `ebp-sync' holds a live
;; attached buffer for the document — the jetpacs-files editor screen
;; and the hub REPL attach exactly this way — the harvest runs THERE,
;; because the live buffer carries completion sources the shadow can
;; never have: an eglot-managed buffer's LSP capf above all, plus every
;; buffer-local addition.  The shadow remains the answer for documents
;; nothing attached (dialog seeds, never-visited ids) and the fallback
;; when the live arm cannot answer (text diverged mid-flush, a slow
;; backend overran `ebp-complete-live-timeout').
;;
;; Who installs the harvester is the layer above's business: this
;; module names no caller and requires none.  For the reader — Jetpacs
;; makes it the connect-time default (`jetpacs-connect', when the caller
;; supplied nothing), and a JC-4b picker prompt registers its own source
;; for its own document in ebp.el's `edit-complete-overrides' table, so
;; the harvester keeps answering for every other document while a
;; prompt is up.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

;; A seam, never a require: the live-buffer arm exists only when
;; `ebp-sync' is loaded, and this module's whole dependency surface
;; stays `cl-lib' (the delineation the commentary promises).
(declare-function ebp-sync-attached-buffer "ebp-sync" (document editor-id))

;; The other half of the same discipline: ebp.el's amendment-#172 doc
;; seam is a dynamic variable this module SETQs during a harvest run
;; (the handler let-binds it around the funcall and snapshots it after).
;; A value-less `defvar' marks it special here without requiring ebp.

Also bound by `ebp-sync--run-exit-fn' (R2) around a completion exit
function, which blocks the same way — the flag means \"a throw-armed
bounded wait inside wire-driven code\".  Read by two parties, both by
name only.  THIS module: a nested `edit.complete' dispatched while the
extent waits skips the live arm and answers from the shadow — two
stacked waits would share `with-timeout's macroexpansion-minted catch
tag, and the outer timer's throw would be stolen by the inner catch,
leaving the outer wait unbounded.  The JETPACS layer:
`jetpacs-flow-continue' postpones its continuations while this is up,
so a continuation that WAITS (a bridged prompt, hub.eval) is never on
the timeout throw's unwind path.")

DOC-FN is the winning capf's `:company-doc-buffer'; ORIGINALS the
index-aligned vector of PROPERTIZED shipped candidates — eglot's
doc-buffer reads the `eglot--lsp-item' text property and is useless on
a stripped twin; BUF the harvest buffer.

The closure re-enters BUF before funcalling DOC-FN: jsonrpc dispatches
every inbound message inside a `with-temp-buffer' (emacs-30.1
jsonrpc.el:807-809), and `eglot-current-server' resolves from
buffer-local state behind an explicit fundamental-mode guard
\(eglot.el:2108-2120, gh#1330) — without the re-entry every eglot doc
fetch would signal, degrade to \"\", and stay green under every
buffer-agnostic fixture (the R5 review's P1, found by three lenses).
The `ebp-sync--run-exit-fn' blocking discipline applies verbatim: nil
immediately when a bounded wait is already on the stack — stacked
`with-timeout's share one macroexpansion-minted catch tag — else latch
\(a nested `edit.complete' takes the shadow; `jetpacs-flow-continue'
keeps waiting continuations off the throw's unwind path), bound by
`ebp-complete-doc-timeout', and degrade every failure to nil.

DOC-FN's convention (company's doc-buffer): a buffer, a buffer name,
or (BUFFER-OR-NAME . POINT) — elisp-mode returns `help-buffer's NAME,
eglot a buffer object.  The doc is the buffer's widened text,
stripped: eglot's markup render returns fontified text."

buffer text diverged from the mirror TEXT (CURSOR addresses TEXT; a
buffer mid-flush holds different text and every offset would lie), the
harvest overran `ebp-complete-live-timeout' — or it simply found
nothing.  An empty live harvest is a fall-through, not an answer: the
shadow additionally carries `ebp-complete-shadow-setup-hook' sources
the live buffer never ran, and silencing those for attached documents
would break this module's own extension contract.

Point is moved under `save-excursion', and the harvest only reads — a
capf that mutates its buffer is broken everywhere, not just here.

Hazards of running capfs inside a jsonrpc REQUEST handler, bounded
rather than eliminated.  A blocking backend (an LSP server thinking)
is cut off by the timeout because its wait sits in
`accept-process-output', which runs timers — one spinning in C without
yielding is not cut off, the same limit `with-timeout' has everywhere.
While a backend waits, the ebp process filter may dispatch nested
work: an inbound `edit.delta' can move this very buffer under the
harvest, costing at worst a garbage offer the Companion's SPEC 19.3
selection gate discards; a nested `edit.complete' takes the shadow via
the latch above; and user-facing continuations are kept OFF this
extent entirely by `jetpacs-flow-continue's deferral, because the
timeout throw unwinding through a waiting prompt would abandon it
mid-round-trip."
