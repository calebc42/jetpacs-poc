;;; Commentary:

;; Upstream: Components.kt `SearchBars' + Examples.kt
;; `SearchBarExamples' (3 examples), samples/SearchBarSamples.kt.
;;
;; All three are recreated on the `search_bar' node -- the 44th type,
;; which exists because of this module.  The node splits its state the
;; way the component does: the QUERY is device-held keyed on `:id'
;; (text_input's machinery, reported in state.changed), while the
;; Collapsed/Expanded state is Companion-local presentation with no wire
;; member at all, so a re-push cannot slam the bar shut under the user's
;; finger.  The `:variant' names where the expanded results surface goes
;; -- full_screen or docked to the field's own measured width -- which
;; is exactly what separated the two scaffold samples from each other.
;;
;; The results under every sample are SampleSearchResults: ten
;; "Suggestion N" ListItems, a Star leading, "Additional info"
;; supporting.  They ride as the node's CHILDREN, revealed only while
;; the bar is expanded.  Upstream's result tap writes the suggestion
;; back into the field and collapses the bar; the wire's query is
;; device-held and nothing short of an input reset writes it from
;; Emacs, so the tap here reports through the demo verb instead -- the
;; row is live, and what it cannot do is said rather than faked.
;;
;; The two scaffold samples put upstream's AppBarWithSearch in the
;; Example screen's own `:top-bar' slot (see `jetpacs-m3-slot-keys'):
;; the Menu and Account icon buttons stand around the field, each under
;; the plain tooltip upstream gives it, and the field between them is
;; the `search_bar' node at weight 1.
;; `SearchBarDefaults.enterAlwaysSearchBarScrollBehavior' -- the bar
;; hiding as the body scrolls -- maps to the scaffold's own
;; `:scroll-behavior "enter_always"' on the styled small bar.
;;
;; Two seams the recreation does not cross.  The renderer draws the
;; authored `:leading-icon' in BOTH states, so the Search glyph does not
;; swap to a Back arrow while expanded the way SampleLeadingIcon's does
;; -- collapse rides submit and the system back instead.  And upstream's
;; Menu/Account buttons slide away as the contained bar expands
;; (AnimatedVisibility on the SearchBarState); here the full-screen
;; expansion covers them, which reads the same but is not an animation
;; the wire can name.
