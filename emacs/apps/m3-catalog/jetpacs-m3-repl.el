;;; Commentary:

;; The live half of an Example screen's Lisp projection.  Source lets you
;; READ the exact sample; this module lets you CHANGE and evaluate it.
;;
;; The projection holds the sample's own authored elisp, seeded into a
;; synchronized editor with real `elisp-completion-at-point' answering from
;; Emacs, and a history of what you have evaluated.  Send a form that returns
;; a node and the Preview projection re-renders as that node.  Send anything
;; else and its printed value lands in a card.
;;
;; THE SAMPLE STAYS THE SAMPLE.  An override is per example, keyed by
;; `jetpacs-m3-example-screen-id', so nothing you do here leaks into a
;; sibling — and it is discarded by the Reset row, which every panel
;; carries, because a catalog whose samples have quietly stopped being
;; upstream's samples is no longer a catalog.  Nothing is persisted:
;; reloading the module is a reset.
;;
;; The editor is ordinary projection content, never a scaffold slot.  That is
;; important for Bottom Sheet and every other sample whose own presentation
;; legitimately occupies the bottom of the display.

without an `:on-submit', and a password field refuses
`:clear-on-submit' outright — so a knob derived from the arglist alone
is offered on samples where every turn of it is an error card.  81 of
506 were, measured.

So each candidate is TRIED against this sample's own other arguments,
at EVERY value it offers, and kept only if all of them build.  Every
value, not a representative one: probing only the first missed
`jetpacs-dropdown''s `:editable', which takes `t' happily and refuses
`:json-false' when the sample has no `:on-change' — a knob that worked
