;;; Commentary:

;; Upstream: Components.kt `Lists' + Examples.kt
;; `ListsExamples' (12 examples), samples/ListSamples.kt.
;;
;; There is no `list_item' node.  M3-COMPONENT-LOOKUP records the
;; ratified position -- "Jetpacs currently achieves this with manual
;; row/column composition inside card", which is exactly what
;; `jetpacs-chrome-row' is -- so the ANATOMY every ListItem sample
;; exists to show (leading content, an overline/headline/supporting text
;; column, trailing content, `HorizontalDivider's between rows) survives
;; composition from wrapped nodes, and is authored here.
;;
;; TRIAGE.  Two things upstream demonstrates have no wire member:
;;
;; * SELECTION.  `ListItem(selected =, onClick =)' makes a whole row one
;;   exclusive choice with a `RadioButton' as its indicator.  No
;;   container node carries a `selected' member and there is no
;;   `radio_button' node type; `enum_list' is the only single-selection
;;   stateful node -- M3-COMPONENT-LOOKUP records RadioButton as
;;   "currently achievable via enum_list with multi_select: false" -- and
;;   `RenderEnumList' lays it out as a `FlowRow' of `FilterChip's, not as
;;   list rows.  Both SingleSelection samples are unsupported.
;;   MULTI-selection is a different story: `checkbox' IS a node with its
;;   own live state, so both MultiSelection samples compose around a
;;   real checkbox and are authored.
;;
;; * MODE CHANGE.  `ListItemWithModeChangeOnLongClickSample' now builds:
;;   `box.on_long_tap' gives a composed row a long-press dispatch, and
;;   the whole-list mode flip lives where it always belonged -- in the
;;   app.  Each row is a box whose on_tap counts or toggles and whose
;;   on_long_tap runs a COMPOUND mutation (enter selection mode checking
;;   the pressed row; exit clearing every row) registered on the
;;   `m3catalog.fn' verb, so one gesture rewriting the siblings is just
;;   Emacs rewriting its own model and re-pushing.  The selection-mode
;;   checkbox is authored and inert, which is upstream verbatim: its
;;   Checkbox passes onCheckedChange = null and the row's own click
;;   does the toggling.
;;
;; The SELECTION gap was re-triaged against the members that landed
;; since.  `button' and `icon_button' now carry `checked'/`on_change'
;; (and `icon_button' a `checked_icon'), which is the nearest thing yet
;; to a radio indicator -- but a checked node holds only its OWN value
;; on the device, and nothing makes a group of them exclusive, which is
;; precisely what the SingleSelection samples exist to show.  So that
;; gap stands.  The rest of the session's vocabulary does not reach a
;; ListItem sample either: upstream draws no chip, no tooltip and no
;; elevated card here, and the segmented group keeps `bg' + `corner'
;; rather than a `surface', because `surface.shape' names whole shapes
;; and cannot spell the four distinct radii of `segmentedShapes'.
;;
;; `SegmentedListItem' needs no special pleading:
;; `ListItemDefaults.segmentedShapes(index, count)' rounds the outer
;; corners of the first and last row of a group and nearly squares the
;; inner ones, and the universal `corner' attribute takes exactly those
;; four radii over a `bg' -- so the segmented grouping is authored, as
;; is the last sample's expansion, which is what a `collapsible' is.
;;
;; One detail is lost throughout: upstream taps increment a
;; `rememberSaveable' counter.  The catalog's one handler is
;; `jetpacs-m3-demo', so a tap reports as a snackbar and a trailing
;; count stays at the 0 it starts at.
