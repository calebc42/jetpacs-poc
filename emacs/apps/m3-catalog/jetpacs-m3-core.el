;;; Commentary:

;; The Tier-1 skeleton of the Material 3 Compose Catalog -- the Jetpacs
;; component vocabulary -- recreated in Elisp: the component registry,
;; the three screens, and the verbs.  Component content lives in the sibling
;; `jetpacs-m3-<slug>.el' modules, one per catalog component, each
;; calling `jetpacs-m3-defcomponent'.
;;
;; The upstream app is
;; resources/android/Compose-Material-3-Expressive-Catalog.  Its
;; navigation is three deep — Home (a grid of components) → Component
;; (icon, description, a list of examples) → Example (one sample,
;; centered) — which is exactly `jetpacs-chrome-max-screens' (3), so
;; the stack never evicts on the main path.
;;
;; FIDELITY RULE.  Every component and every example of the upstream
;; catalog is listed, in upstream order, with its upstream name and
;; description.  An example whose sample cannot be expressed in the EBP
;; node vocabulary is declared `:unsupported REASON' and drills into a
;; "Not supported" screen carrying that reason — the catalog stays a
;; complete index of M3, and the gaps are visible instead of missing.
;; docs/lookup-tables/M3-COMPONENT-LOOKUP.org is the map of which M3
;; components Jetpacs wraps.

  "Describe one catalog example; returns the plist the registry stores.
NAME and DESCRIPTION are upstream's; SOURCE is its sourceUrl; EXPRESSIVE
mirrors `isExpressive'.

An example is either RECREATED or UNSUPPORTED, never both.  A recreated
one gives at least one of:

  BUILD     a nullary function returning the Node shown in the body;
  SLOTS     a plist of `jetpacs-m3-slot-keys' -> nullary function (or,
            for :snackbar, a string), claiming the Example screen's own
            scaffold slots;
  TOP-BAR   a function of one argument BACK (a `view.switch' descriptor,
            nil at the stack bottom) returning the screen's whole top
            bar.  It MUST offer a way back — use `jetpacs-m3-back-button'.

SCAFFOLD is a plist of §17.6 members appended verbatim to this screen's own
scaffold — the general door for anything that is NOT a builder, so a sample
whose subject is a scaffold member the harness has never heard of can ask
for it WITHOUT a change here.  `jetpacs-scaffold' validates it, so a
misspelled member is an error there rather than a silent drop.

    :slots (list :floating-toolbar #\='my-toolbar)
    :scaffold (list :floating-toolbar-orientation \"horizontal\"
                    :floating-toolbar-placement \"bottom_end\")

The named TOP-BAR-* / SCROLL-BEHAVIOR / FLOATING-TOOLBAR-* keywords are
sugar over the same plist, kept because modules already read that way.  Two
rules they carry: a styled top bar puts TOP-BAR's node in the real bar's
TITLE slot and has no actions slot, so a sample's actions and its way back
both live inside that node; and SCROLL-BEHAVIOR needs TOP-BAR-STYLE, which
`jetpacs-scaffold' enforces.

UNSUPPORTED is a sentence naming the wire member or node type the
sample would need; the example then drills into \"Not supported\"."

a module can be re-evaluated live without duplicating or reordering.

BUILDERS names the `jetpacs-' NODE BUILDERS this M3 component is made of
— `jetpacs-button' for Buttons, `jetpacs-scaffold' for Bottom Sheet —
and the Component screen shows each one's docstring under upstream's
description.  It is authored, not derived, and it has to be: a count of
which constructors a module's samples CALL is dominated by scenery
(`jetpacs-column' appears everywhere and means nothing), and the answer
for a third of the catalog is `jetpacs-scaffold', which the samples
never call at all because the Example screen builds the scaffold around
them.  Which component a sample IS is a judgement.

The mapping is 1:1 with M3 only at the vocabulary layer, exactly as
docs/CHROME-VOCABULARY.md says: `scaffold' bundles eight-odd composables

THE DOCSTRING DECIDES.  An example is built from up to three functions —
`:build', `:top-bar', and its `:slots' — and which of them is THE SAMPLE
cannot be read off the plist key, because it goes both ways:

  a sample that IS chrome claims `:top-bar' or a slot, and its `:build'
  is only a backdrop, usually one several examples share — a hundred
  lines for the bar to collapse over.  Ask `:build' and a full-screen
  search bar describes itself as \"the Scaffold content both scaffold
  samples share\";

  and the mirror image, which is just as real: two examples can share
  ONE chrome builder and differ in their bodies, so
  `PinnedTopAppBarWithReversedLazyGrid' has the shared `--pinned' bar
  and a `--reversed-grid' body of its own.  Ask the chrome and that
  screen names its SIBLING's upstream sample.

Both wrong answers are plausible, which is what makes a positional rule
a trap.  So ask the functions instead: the one whose docstring NAMES
this example is the one written for it.  Every sample builder in this
tree opens \"Upstream <Name>...\" — the authoring brief requires it — so
the discriminator is the same convention the docstrings already keep.
A longer name outranks a shorter one for free, because
`PinnedTopAppBar' is a substring of its own longer sibling but not the
reverse.

Chrome-first survives only as the TIEBREAK, for the examples whose
builders name nothing.

Only a SYMBOL can answer: an inline lambda has no docstring to read, and
`:snackbar' (a string) and `:on-refresh' (a descriptor) are not functions
at all, so the `fboundp' test is load-bearing rather than defensive."
