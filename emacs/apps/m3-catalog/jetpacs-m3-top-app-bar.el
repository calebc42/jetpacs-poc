;;; Commentary:

;; Upstream: Components.kt `TopAppBar' + Examples.kt
;; `TopAppBarExamples' (15 examples), samples/AppBarSamples.kt.
;;
;; A top app bar IS screen chrome, so the recreated samples claim the
;; Example screen's own `:top-bar' slot instead of nesting a second
;; scaffold in the body -- see `jetpacs-m3-slot-keys'.  `:build' carries
;; what upstream scrolls under every one of these bars: the numbers 0 to
;; 75.
;;
;; EVERY BAR HERE IS A REAL M3 TopAppBar.  `:top-bar-style' (small,
;; center, medium, large, medium_flexible, large_flexible, two_rows)
;; makes the Example screen's scaffold render an actual TopAppBar /
;; CenterAlignedTopAppBar / MediumTopAppBar / LargeTopAppBar /
;; MediumFlexibleTopAppBar / LargeFlexibleTopAppBar / TwoRowsTopAppBar
;; instead of the plain status-bar-padded Row it draws without one,
;; `:top-bar-subtitle' is the second line M3 puts under the title (the
;; flexible styles center both under `top_bar_centered'), and
;; `:scroll-behavior' (pinned, enter_always, exit_until_collapsed) also
;; puts Modifier.nestedScroll on the Scaffold, so the bar genuinely
;; recolors, hides or folds as the body scrolls.
;;
;; What that bar does NOT have is an actions slot, and its navigationIcon
;; is the Companion's own drawer hamburger, which the Example screen has
;; no drawer for.  So the node a `:top-bar' function returns is the TITLE
;; slot's content and carries everything else: the way back first (a
;; `:top-bar' replaces the screen's whole bar, so the arrow has nowhere
;; else to live), then the sample's Menu navigationIcon, the title, and
;; the actions.  For the `center' style that node must also SPAN the bar
;; -- CenterAlignedTopAppBar centers the title composable, so a composable
;; narrower than the bar would centre nothing -- which is why
;; `jetpacs-m3-top-app-bar--centered-bar' is a full-width `box' with the
;; icon row behind a centered title.
;;
;; TRIAGE.  Thirteen of the fifteen are recreated: the four Simple bars
;; (title, subtitle, centered, centered with subtitle), the four whose
;; subject is a scroll behavior the wire spells exactly -- PinnedTopAppBar
;; (pinned), EnterAlwaysTopAppBar (enter_always) and the Medium and Large
;; ExitUntilCollapsed bars (exit_until_collapsed on the medium and large
;; styles) -- and SimpleTopAppBarWithAdaptiveActions on the `app_bar_row'
;; node, which folds the actions that do not fit into the more_vert menu
;; at measure time (upstream's ADDITIONAL window-class cap stays a stated
;; seam: no wire message reports a size class to cap by); the two
;; Flexible bars on the flexible styles, subtitled and centered; and
;; CustomTwoRowsTopAppBar on the two_rows style, whose title slot takes
;; the expanded flag on the DEVICE -- `top_bar' while folded,
;; `top_bar_expanded' while open, 64dp/156dp authored heights -- so the
;; string swap upstream demonstrates crosses the wire as two nodes and
;; no collapse fraction ever needs a reporting channel.
;;
;; What remains is not layout and not a bare behavior (the reversed-grid
;; bullet below records a recreation's stated seams, not a gap):
;; * PinnedTopAppBarWithPreScrolledLazyColumn and
;;   EnterAlwaysTopAppBarWithReverseScrolling are both about ARGUMENTS to
;;   the behavior -- a lazyListState, a scrollState with reverseScrolling
;;   -- and `scroll_behavior' is a bare enum, so the Companion always
;;   constructs the behavior with none.  The first also wants a list node
;;   opened at item 30, which nothing carries.
;; * PinnedTopAppBarWithReversedLazyGrid rides the `lazy_grid' node now,
;;   with its two seams stated on the example: the bounded height a lazy
;;   container needs in this body, and the bar recolor tracking
;;   nested-scroll deltas rather than the grid's own scrollableState.
;;
;; Upstream wraps every IconButton in a TooltipBox with a PlainTooltip
;; repeating its label, anchored TooltipAnchorPosition.Above.  That is the
;; `tooltip' node's own default, so the recreations author it --
;; `jetpacs-m3-top-app-bar--tipped' -- and the label rides
;; `:content-description' as well, where a screen reader looks.
