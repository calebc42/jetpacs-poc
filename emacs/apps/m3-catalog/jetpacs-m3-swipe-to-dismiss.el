;; This is one of the few M3 gestures the wire carries outright: the
;; card node has `swipe_start' and `swipe_end' members, each a swipe
;; side {label, icon?, color?, on_trigger}, and the Companion renders
;; them with the very composable the sample demonstrates -- a
;; `SwipeToDismissBox' over `rememberSwipeToDismissBoxState', with a
;; direction-dependent colored background.  So the one example
;; recreates: an outlined-card list row that is swipeable both ways,
;; green forward and red back.

  "Upstream SwipeToDismissListItems: one swipeable \"Cupcake\" row.
The sample wraps an OutlinedCard/ListItem in a SwipeToDismissBox whose
backgroundContent is Green for StartToEnd and Red for EndToStart, and
whose onDismiss hides the item on EndToStart and calls
`dismissState.reset' on StartToEnd.  The card node carries that as
:swipe-start and :swipe-end; the two colors ride as the `success' and
`error' roles, which is what Green and Red mean here.

Per SPEC §17.3 a swiped item never settles dismissed on the Companion
-- it returns to rest and the server's list decides -- so removal is
the catalog's demo verb reporting the direction, as everywhere else."
