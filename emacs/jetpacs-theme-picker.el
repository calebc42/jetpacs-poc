;;; Commentary:

;; The generic half of a theme picker/control satellite screen: palette
;; strip and per-theme preview swatches, prefix-stripped display names,
;; the companion-mirror note, the current-theme header card, the
;; light/dark grouped picker, and the customize cross-link.  A concrete
;; screen supplies its provider functions (theme list, current, dark-p,
;; palette color) and its action names.  Concrete theme packages remain
;; downstream because their providers are app dependencies, not foundation
;; dependencies.
;;
;; Foundation module by the ratified §3 step-3 promotion
;; (docs/PLAN-jetpacs-debt-and-scaffold.md), REVERSING the
;; earlier app-local ruling that had parked the picker beside its first
;; consumer pending a second one.  The reversal costs nothing because the closure was
;; foundation-only from the day it landed — cl-lib, subr-x,
;; jetpacs-widgets, and zero downstream symbols — so under the 2026-08-06
;; naming rule (a prefix is a claim about the require closure) the old
;; prefix overclaimed, and the rename IS the whole promotion.
;;
;; G8 port of v1 core jetpacs-theme-picker.el.  Rewrites against v1:
;;  - `jetpacs-swatch' has no v3 node helper: the chip is a shaped
;;    `jetpacs-surface' sized through `jetpacs-with-attrs' (width and
;;    height are universal attributes, not surface members).
;;  - The mirror note receives the concrete provider's theme mode explicitly
;;    and treats `mirror' as active, rather than reaching into
;;    `jetpacs-theme' and recreating its dependency cycle.
;;  - Action `:args' are member plists (T3); positional text styles are
;;    `:style' strings (T5).
;;
;; Per-theme previews gate on `modus-themes-activate' — the modus 5.0
;; palette machinery that resolving a NON-current theme's colors needs;
;; derivative families built on that API (ef-themes 2.0+) get previews
;; for free, and older providers degrade to clean name-only rows.
