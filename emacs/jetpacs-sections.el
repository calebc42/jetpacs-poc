;;; Commentary:

;; Tier 0.5: one renderer for every buffer built on the magit-section
;; library — magit status/log/diff/refs, forge topics, kubernetes.el, and
;; every `taxy-magit-section' consumer.  ONE renderer per framework, and
;; every package built on it arrives pre-skinned.
;;
;; Under Tier 0 these buffers already render acceptably.  What this
;; substrate adds: the section TREE becomes real `collapsible' cards —
;; folding is instant and client-side, no round trip — and a long-press
;; on any header offers that section's OWN key bindings, so the phone
;; gets magit's per-section verbs without one command name ever crossing
;; the wire (the wire carries keys and positions; the buffer's keymaps
;; decide meaning).
;;
;; FOLD STATE IS DEVICE-LOCAL, deliberately.  Emacs's `hidden' bit seeds
;; the FIRST snapshot of a card and nothing after it: SPEC 17.3 makes
;; `collapsible.collapsed' seed-only for a presentation identity, so
;; local expansion survives a repeated authored value — and since the
;; card id is deliberately stable across refreshes (that is what keeps
;; fold state attached to the same section), a changed `hidden' bit has
;; no effect on a card the device has already seen.  That is the right
;; trade: folding stays instant and round-trip-free, and the phone's
;; view of a long magit-status is not yanked around by an unrelated
;; refresh in Emacs.  The alternative — folding `hidden' into the id —
;; would mint a new identity on every toggle and discard all other
;; device-local state for that card along with it.
;;
;; The library is third-party (NonGNU ELPA): nothing here requires it.
;; Reading the tree uses `slot-value' (eieio is built-in), and registration
;; waits for the library via `with-eval-after-load'.
;;
;; Body lines ride the Tier 0 line-span builder unchanged (monospace and
;; colors on — diffs keep their +/- shading, taps keep working), so this
;; file knows only the tree shape.  A buffer whose root section is missing
;; falls through to Tier 0 — the substrate is polish, never a prerequisite.
;;
;; Rung JC-3a of docs/PLAN-jetpacs-consumers.md.  Ported from poc-v1 with
;; the span surgery moved alist -> plist, plus three conformance changes:
;;
;; - The retargeted taps are RE-EXPOSED under their new verb.  Exposure
;;   records are per-action (SPEC 23.1), and the Tier-0 builder exposed
;;   these positions for `emacs.buffer.act'; rewriting the descriptor to
;;   `sections.visit' without re-exposing would make every tap refused.
;; - `sections.menu' no longer calls `completing-read' in the handler.
;;   That blocks the jsonrpc dispatch extent (decision D2), so the
;;   Companion would never learn the outcome.  The picker is an EBP dialog.
;; - Optional node types degrade to Core (SPEC 16.2).
