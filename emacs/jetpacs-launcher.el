;;; Commentary:

;; JA-6's last surface (decision D-12: the launcher stays Emacs-side —
;; "apps are configs").  The reference Companion presents ONE app
;; surface at a time, last push wins, and nothing device-side switches
;; between them; this module is the switcher.  Its root lists every
;; `app:*' surface with a registered builder.  Widget, notification,
;; and tile roots are device projections rather than navigation
;; destinations, so they never enter the launcher.  A row tap re-pushes
;; its app surface, which is what "switching" means under
;; last-write-wins.
;;
;; Reaching the launcher has the same shape as the problem it solves,
;; so `jetpacs.launcher.show' is a GLOBAL VERB (`:any-surface', the
;; theme-toggle precedent): a drawer-less screen may embed
;; `jetpacs-launcher-button' in its top bar.  Since the S8 drawer
;; seam that set is small — standalone-pole surfaces and non-chrome
;; roots; build-within roots reach here through the injected drawer.

APP, not the surface, and a claimed SECONDARY (Org Mode claims the
Files surface) keeps its own identity.  The seeded tables remain
the vocabulary for platform surfaces (Settings, SQL, …), which are
deliberately not apps; last comes the namespace-stripped

honest id than a wrongly prettified one)."
