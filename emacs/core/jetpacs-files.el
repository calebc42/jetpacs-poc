;;; jetpacs-files.el --- File browser & editor for Jetpacs -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; A dired-style file browser plus a plain-text editor, rendered through
;; Jetpacs surfaces. Together with the eval tab this is the self-hosting
;; plumbing: init.el (and anything else) can be edited, saved, and
;; reloaded from the phone, so the desktop side never needs touching
;; once jetpacs is in the init file.
;;
;; Registers two shell views:
;;   "files" — root list / directory listing (a bottom-bar tab)
;;   "edit"  — editor for `jetpacs-files--file' (present while a file is open)
;;
;; App seams — this module knows nothing about org (or any file type):
;;   `jetpacs-files-editor-body-functions'    replace the editor body per file
;;   `jetpacs-files-editor-actions-functions' add top-bar buttons per file
;;   `jetpacs-files-open-hook'                react to a file being opened
;;   `jetpacs-files-after-save-hook'          react to a phone-side save
