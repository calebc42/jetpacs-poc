;;; Commentary:

;; The application-framework floor's registry half (rung JC-0 of
;; docs/PLAN-jetpacs-consumers.md; build spec docs/SPEC-JC-0-floor.md).
;; Rebuild-lite of poc-v1 `jetpacs-surfaces.el': the ownership registry
;; and action/state seams port; every transport seam re-wires onto
;; `ebp-client-*'.  ebp.el owns each SPEC 24.2 endpoint duty; this file
;; owns the registries the application layers share.
;;
;; Decisions (spec section 0):
;; - D1: per-owner surfaces `app:<owner>' — owner strings are wire
;;   identifiers, validated at claim time, stable across sessions.
;; - D2: an action handler MUST NOT block.  It runs inside jsonrpc.el's
;;   dispatch extent; its return value IS the protocol reply.  Prompts
;;   run from a `run-at-time' 0 continuation.
;; - Q1: single client.  `jetpacs-attach' errors on a second live client.
;; - Q3: a non-status handler return answers `rejected' with a loud
;;   warning — never a durable blanket-accept, never a bare -32603.
;; - Q4: `jetpacs-event-stale-p' is a helper a handler opts into; lag
;;   alone is not semantic staleness.
;; - Q5: state subscriptions key by bare widget id (app ids are already
;;   namespaced).

  `with-timeout' cannot break, because the timer's own signal is eaten
  by the same handler.
- `x-popup-dialog' is reachable from the C body of `yes-or-no-p'
  (src/fns.c:3546) whenever `use-dialog-box' is on and the last event
  was a mouse event, bypassing the minibuffer entirely.  Verified: that
  configuration RETURNS nil instead of signalling, so a handler would
  silently receive \"no\" rather than a refusal — a wrong answer, which
  is worse than a hang.  `use-dialog-box' is also bound nil below, so
  this stub is the second lock on that door.

Native compilation makes `subrp' useless for deciding what can be
intercepted (a native-compiled Lisp function is a subr too, so
`subr-primitive-p' is the real predicate) — but `cl-letf' on
`symbol-function' works for both, which is why this list needs no such
distinction.

THE RULE when adding to this list: stub the TOP-LEVEL entry point, never
trust the inner read to signal.  `read-multiple-choice' is why — a
caller that catches errors around its own read and retries turns a
refusal into an infinite loop, and stubbing `read-event' underneath it
would have made things WORSE, not better.  A sweep of Emacs 30.1 found
rmc.el to be the only instance of that shape in the standard library,
but a third-party package is free to write the same loop."))

(defmacro jetpacs-with-no-prompts (&rest body)
  "Run BODY with every way of blocking on the local user turned into a signal.

The single worst failure mode in this bridge: an action handler runs
INSIDE the jsonrpc dispatch extent, and its return value IS the reply.
Anything that waits for local input there never returns — the Companion
waits forever for an answer, and on a headless daemon there is no user
and no terminal to answer with.  Decision D2 bans it, but D2 is a rule
about code being WRITTEN correctly; this macro makes it structural.

Two mechanisms, because neither alone suffices:

- `inhibit-interaction' (Emacs 27+) is the built-in answer and covers
  the whole minibuffer family plus `read-char'/`read-event', signalling
  `inhibited-interaction' — an `error' subtype, so `jetpacs--dispatch'
  catches it and answers `rejected'.
- `jetpacs--blocking-readers' names the five that ignore it and hang;
  they are stubbed to signal the same condition.

It also holds THROUGH TIMERS, which is what makes it worth having.
Verified on the live runtime: a body that calls `accept-process-output'
runs pending timers inside this extent, and those callbacks still see
the binding.  That is the exact shape of comint's password prompt — a
process filter defers `read-passwd' into `run-at-time' 0, and the
echo-wait loop's `accept-process-output' then pulls it in — so the
deferral cannot be used to escape the ban.

What it does NOT do: stop a handler from taking a long time.  D2 bans
blocking on the USER, not bounded local work (magit's washer runs `git
diff'; `Info-toc' reads files).  Those stay the caller's judgement."

PARAMS is the full `event.action' params plist (`:event_id' `:surface'
`:revision_seen' `:dialog_id' `:fields' ...).  FN MUST return
`accepted', `stale', or `rejected' (never `duplicate' — ebp synthesizes
it from the receipt store), MUST NOT block (decision D2: it runs inside
the jsonrpc dispatch extent and its return value is the reply), and
MUST return `accepted' only once the effect is durable.

Registers into the global staging table and, when a client is attached,
into its live allowlist; `jetpacs-attach' replays the table into every
future client.

When registered under `with-jetpacs-owner', the dispatch REJECTS an
event whose wire surface is not the owner's (SPEC 14.4 validates the
surface context BEFORE invoking behavior).  ANY-SURFACE non-nil
declares a GLOBAL VERB exempt from that scope — for an owner-attributed
action whose button any surface may legitimately render.

ARGS and DOC are the action's INTROSPECTION schema, poc-v1's typed arg
declarations returning to the floor.  ARGS is a list of plists, one per
argument the handler reads out of the event:

    :args \\='((:name value :type \"text\" :required t)
            (:name date  :type \"date\"))

each carrying a symbol `:name' and optionally a string `:type' and a
plain-boolean `:required'.  DOC is a one-line description.  Both are
validated at REGISTRATION time and loudly — a malformed schema is a
code bug in the app, and a schema that only fails when some editor
tries to read it fails in the wrong place, months later.  The `:type'
VOCABULARY stays OPEN: poc-v1's set (\"text\" \"number\" \"enum\" \"date\"
\"ref\" \"bool\") is a convention, not a closed enum, because the thing
that interprets a type is the editor the app itself authors.

Metadata NEVER gates dispatch — a schemaless registration is as valid
as it ever was, and a re-registration that omits ARGS and DOC CLEARS
the stale ones, the same rule ANY-SURFACE follows.  Nothing here
crosses the wire; read it back with `jetpacs-action-schema'."

subscriber lands between them.

The arity is FIXED at (CLIENT).  Widening an established abnormal hook
breaks SILENTLY — as `jetpacs-teardown-surfaces' records, a second
argument signals `wrong-number-of-arguments' in every existing
subscriber, and the isolation here swallows it.  Context rides a
dynamic variable, never a second argument.")

The attachment point for module-private per-owner state (reminders
bookkeeping, chrome stacks, future registries) — the rewrite's answer
to the poc's fboundp ladder.  Runs after every core registry is swept,
so a hook observing the owner's claims sees them already gone.  The
surfaces it swept are in `jetpacs-teardown-surfaces'; a per-surface
subscriber MUST read that, never recompute.  Each fn runs isolated: one
failure logs its error SYMBOL and the rest still run.  Lives on the

  "The surfaces the in-progress `jetpacs-teardown-owner' is sweeping.
Bound around the WHOLE sweep — the registry pass and
`jetpacs-teardown-functions' alike — to the list computed ONCE, BEFORE
anything is unclaimed.  A hook cannot recompute this: by the time the
hooks run the owner's surface claims are gone, so
`jetpacs-shell--owner-surfaces' then answers only the D1 primary and a
per-surface subscriber silently leaks every secondary surface (the
JA-2 chrome stale-stack bug).  Read it synchronously inside the hook;
a deferred read sees nil.  Context rides a dynamic variable rather
than a second hook argument because (OWNER) is the hook's PUBLIC
arity: a two-argument call signals `wrong-number-of-arguments' in
every existing subscriber, and the hook loop isolates errors — so the
break would be SILENT and would stop every module's sweep, not just
the one being fixed.")

(defvar jetpacs-reset-functions nil
  "Normal hook run to drop module state, for tests and teardown.
The test-and-teardown reset seam.  `jetpacs-test-reset-state' clears the
kernel's own tables — nothing outside this file knows they exist — and
then drains this, which is the rewrite's answer to the LAST of the poc's
fboundp ladders: the floor named seven module resets by symbol and
skipped whichever the build had not loaded, so renaming one stopped
resets happening with nothing anywhere to say so.

Members are NULLARY.  A reset is a module talking to itself: no owner,
no client, nothing the floor could pass it that it does not already
know.  They run ISOLATED via `jetpacs-run-isolated', so a module whose
reset breaks costs its own state and not every fixture after it in the
suite.  Order is not a property here — each member clears tables its own
file owns and nobody else reads.

Registered at LOAD by the owning module, in its OWN file, for the reason
`jetpacs-ready-functions' and `jetpacs-teardown-functions' record: the
floor names no module, so a build without one simply has no member for
it.

An `ebp-' file NEVER touches this hook.  The ebp tier is wire and Emacs
only and may not name a `jetpacs-' symbol at all — the delineation guard
in test/run-tests.sh loads each `emacs/ebp*.el' alone and fails on the
first jetpacs-flavored symbol it finds — so an engine's reset is
registered by its jetpacs-side shim/adapter: `jetpacs-org.el' adds
`ebp-org-reset', exactly as it adds `ebp-org-teardown-owner', and
`ebp-org.el' is untouched by either.")
