;;; Commentary:

;; JA-3c: what turns the tablet from "a viewer for whatever a skin
;; pushed" into a general Emacs client — a buffer list, drill-in to any
;; buffer through the Tier-0 renderer (skins apply automatically via
;; `jetpacs-render-buffer'), a *Messages* tail, imenu navigation, the
;; M-x runner, and the command palette over `jetpacs-keymap''s
;; extraction and menu-bar mining.
;;
;; Rebuilt from poc-v1's jetpacs-emacs-ui.el on the JA-2 floor rather
;; than ported: the poc's tab views, drawer items and top-action
;; registries do not exist here — screens live on ONE chrome stack
;; (`jetpacs-chrome-define-root' + push/pop), the drill state that was
;; a module global lives in the stack itself, and the imenu slice state
;; belongs to `jetpacs-results' (the plan's mandate: extend the region
;; view, never parallel it).  The eval REPL is deliberately absent —
;; not in JA-3's scope, and SPEC 23.2 makes it a design decision, not a
;; port.
;;
;; The D2 inversions from the poc:
;;   - imenu and M-x ran `completing-read' INSIDE their handlers; here
;;     every prompt runs in a `jetpacs-flow-continue' continuation,
;;     where the dialog bridge routes it to the device.
;;   - Every action answers its SPEC 14.4 status explicitly and defers
;;     its presenting push (`jetpacs-chrome-push-screen' signals on
;;     gate failure; a handler must never let that signal escape as a
;;     spurious `rejected').
;;
;; SPEC 23.1: the buffer list EXPOSES each listed buffer for the view
;; verb, and the drilled screen exposes its buffer for imenu/palette —
;; a tap naming a buffer this Emacs never offered is refused, exactly
;; like a position tap at an offset never rendered.
