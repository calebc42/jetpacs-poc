;;; ebp-sync.el --- Live buffer sync over EBP Section 19 -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later

;; The buffer bridge for synchronized editors (ARCHITECTURE-POC3 Step 3;
;; behavior reference: POC 1's jetpacs-sync.el, rebuilt against Section
;; 19's first-class methods).  ebp.el keeps the string mirror; this
;; module binds one real buffer to one (document . editor-id) session:
;;
;;   outbound — built-in track-changes.el watches the buffer; each
;;     fetched change becomes ONE `edit.apply' splice, sent strictly one
;;     at a time (one operation contends for seq+1, SPEC 19.4);
;;   inbound — accepted `edit.delta' splices land in the buffer through
;;     ebp.el's splice hook as ONE atomic change, then are consumed from
;;     the tracker so they are never echoed back.
;;
;; Positions are Unicode scalar values = Emacs chars; `start' is the
;; zero-based splice start, so buffer position = start + 1.
;;
;; THE DOCUMENT IS THE WHOLE BUFFER.  A narrowing is a VIEW, and the
;; §19 document never is one: it has no wire representation, no
;; `edit.close' to signal when it changes, and the file the save writes
;; is whole.  So every operation here runs under `save-restriction' +
;; `widen' — the seed comparison, both adoptions, every content
;; snapshot, both annotation walks, the caret's `goto-char', and every
;; `track-changes' touch (register included: the tracker's state is
;; created with the ACCESSIBLE bounds in force, and one created narrowed
;; asserts on the first change outside that restriction, however
;; carefully the change itself widens).  A restriction that can survive
;; is restored; one whose anchoring text a full adoption deletes cannot
;; be, and the buffer is left wide rather than showing an arbitrary
;; window into foreign text.
;;
;; Resynchronization is the ONLY recovery: a fetch reporting `error', a
;; refused or stale apply, a write-protected buffer, or a remote splice
;; racing unsent local edits each drop local pending state and request
;; one `edit.resync'; the reseed arrives as `edit.open' and the buffer
;; adopts it — unless the seed is already its text (nothing to do) or
;; the buffer is write-protected, which answers with the restoring
;; `edit.apply' instead.  Never guess a splice, never send a blind
;; whole-document replacement (SPEC 19.3).  Local edits still queued
;; when a race forces resync are lost by design — bounded by one
;; command's coalesced edit — because replaying them against adopted
;; foreign text WOULD be a guess.

none of the shape guards: empty-prefix and empty-insert accepts, both
invisible to the shape heuristic, validate here.  The offer is

EXTEND (unmarked `del' 0 insertion at the region's end): the #171
qualifying splice — the offer survives, its tracked extension grows,
and nothing fires.  Empty text qualifies too (a degenerate no-op
splice): the SPEC's clause has no non-empty requirement and the
Companion tracker agrees.

PRISTINE HEURISTIC (unmarked, extension zero): R2's provenance-by-
shape, exactly as landed — the deleted prefix and inserted text must
share an end scalar, the shape the Companion's minimal diff can never
emit.  It never fires once any extension is tracked; extension
survival must not widen the unmarked inference surface.

arriving while another is on the stack RE-ARMS (up to 20 x 0.05s)

self-cancel if the buffer moved on.  Both R0 guards cover the blocking
extent: `ebp-complete--live-harvest-active' routes a nested
`edit.complete' to the shadow so no request handler parks on this
stack, and (with `ebp-sync--exit-fn-running') `jetpacs-flow-continue'
keeps waiting continuations off the timeout throw's unwind path.

The postpone gate reads BOTH latches (R5 review): this timer can fire
inside ANOTHER throw-armed bounded wait — the R5 doc provider's, whose
doc-fn waits in `accept-process-output', which runs timers — and a
blocking exit function nested in that extent would sit on the doc
timer's unwind path, the exact R0 trap shape.  Postponing while the

;; 2. Android's phantom-process killer reaps backgrounded language
;;    servers.  Attach runs on every open, so the throttled connect
;;    attempt there is what revives a reaped server the next time the
;;    file opens on the device.
;; 3. `elisp-flymake-byte-compile' spawns "emacs -batch" per check —
;;    impossible on the Android port, where Emacs is a shared library
;;    inside an app process with no executable to spawn, and a
;;    subprocess per typing pause everywhere else once the arm below
;;    kicks a check per edit.  Attached elisp buffers get an in-process
