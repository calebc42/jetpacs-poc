;;; jetpacs-apps.el --- App identity over dock-as-data chrome -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later

;; Groups owned surfaces into named apps, AppSheet-style, over the
;; chrome's dock-as-data seam (design: PLAN-poc1-parity, "The
;; app-identity design").  An app claims its surfaces and contributes
;; dock destinations in the exact `jetpacs-chrome-dock-items-function'
;; item shape; this module composes the seam, it never defines a second
;; vocabulary.
;;
;; The single-app contract (POC 1's, kept): with zero registered apps
;; the composed dock is byte-identical to the host-seeded core items;
;; with one app its destinations merge after core and nothing else
;; appears.  The launcher machinery — the Apps grid surface and the
;; trailing "Apps" destination — exists only from the second app on.
;;
;; THIS IS THE ENTRY POINT for a Tier 1 app:
;;
;;   1. Register your surfaces under (with-jetpacs-owner "<appid>" ...).
;;   2. Finish with `jetpacs-defapp' claiming them and declaring your
;;      dock destinations.
;;
;; One broken app costs its own destinations, never the dock: each
;; app's item builder runs under its own condition-case — the same
;; isolation the session-hook blanking bug taught.

DESTINATIONS is the S1 route registry (CHROME-VOCABULARY v3, the

list of plists (:key :label :verb [:icon :subtitle :badge]) — or a
function of no arguments returning one — naming the screens the app
offers the HOST.  A destination's optional BADGE is a string or a
nullary function returning a string/nil; it is resolved when the bar

the app's default creation action on its own screens.  A screen's
