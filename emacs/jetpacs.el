;;; Commentary:

;; This is the one public loading entry point for package-manager users and
;; the Companion's bundled offline installation alike:

;;   (package-vc-install

;;              :lisp-dir "emacs"))
;;   (require 'jetpacs)

;;; Code:

;; Package activation adds only the package's Lisp root to `load-path'.
;; Jetpacs apps are intentionally kept in separate directories, so make those
;; directories available before package.el byte-compiles the installed tree.

;; at runtime should.  Compose the inert packaged-app manifest here, after the
;; nested app directories are on `load-path': package-vc may have loaded the
;; app-store as a compile dependency earlier in this same Emacs process.
