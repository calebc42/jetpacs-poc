;;; Commentary:

;; The read-eval-print loop the device hub has had since 2026-08-06,
;; lifted out of `device/init.el' so it can have a second caller.
;;
;; It was library work living in personal configuration: a *scratch*-style
;; multi-form evaluator feeding `*' `**' `***', a history of results with
;; copy and re-run, and a pinned input row that is a SYNCHRONIZED §19
;; editor rather than a local draft.  None of that is about being a home
;; screen.  The M3 catalog's Playground wants exactly the same loop over a
;; different subject, and the choice was to duplicate it or to name it.
;;
;; SESSIONS.  Everything here is keyed by a session id, so two REPLs on
;; one device keep separate histories and separate editor documents while
;; sharing one evaluator — and therefore one `*' `**' `***' chain, which
;; is correct: those are Emacs's, not a screen's, and a value yielded in
;; one REPL should be reachable from the other exactly as it would be
;; between two ielm buffers.
;;
;; THE DOCUMENT ID ENDS `.el' ON PURPOSE.  `ebp-complete--mode-for'
;; matches the document against `auto-mode-alist' to pick the shadow
;; buffer's major mode, and that is the whole mechanism by which the
;; phone gets REAL `elisp-completion-at-point' — Emacs is the completion
;; server (SPEC 19.3), the device brings the UI.  A document id without
;; the suffix silently answers nothing.
;;
;; ON EVALUATION AND SPEC 23.2.  §23.2 forbids executing text obtained
;; from an editor field "without a separate explicit trust decision", and
;; a REPL plainly evaluates text obtained from an editor field.  The
;; reading this module rests on: §23.2's subject is text arriving from a
;; QR code, a clipboard, a share intent or a notification into a facility
;; that was not asking for code — the case where the user intended to
;; SEND text, not to run it.  A REPL's input is a field the user
;; knowingly typed a form into for the purpose of evaluating it, and the
;; send tap is the per-invocation act.  There is no ambient promotion
;; here: nothing else on the surface reaches this evaluator, and the
;; editor is not fed by any platform channel.

DOCUMENT must end `.el' — see the Commentary; that suffix is what makes

ARGS.  VALUE seeds the field.

ARGS is not optional decoration for a caller with more than one session.
The send button dispatches with NO value — it reads the mirror — so ARGS
is the only thing on that dispatch saying WHICH session it is for, and
omitting it makes the far end reject every send in silence.  Found on
hardware, by a Playground whose button did nothing at all.

The send button is FILLED.  Authored bare it is, per
`jetpacs-icon-button''s own docstring, \"the plain, container-less icon
button\" — and a container-less glyph beside the editor does not read
as the primary action of the screen.  It was one, and did not look like
one.

The editor is NOT chromeless.  Material drew an outline regardless, but
the Foundation renderer honors the flag and drew nothing: an invisible
strip above the divider that nobody could tell was an input."
