;;; Commentary:

;; JA-1 of docs/PLAN-jetpacs-apps.md: the owner-scoped reminders wrapper
;; over `ebp-client-reminders-set' (SPEC 18.6).  The verdict pass
;; promoted this to the poc device module's highest-value shippable
;; piece: the Companion half is implemented and durable, and a reminder
;; is the one JA-1 capability that works while nobody is looking at the
;; screen.
;;
;; What the rewrite dropped from the poc: the capability NEGOTIATION.
;; SPEC 18.6 makes `owner' REQUIRED and non-empty and gates the method
;; on the `reminders.owner' grant, so the poc's "no capability -> send a
;; global set" fallback guarded an impossibility — there is no method
;; for it to call.  The empty-string default owner dies with it: an
;; ownerless set would let unrelated modules clobber each other, the
;; exact thing 18.6's partitioning exists to prevent.
;;
;; D1 correction that shapes every tap handler (SPEC 14.4): a reminder
;; tap OMITS the surface/revision/dialog context members — its source
;; identity arrives in Companion-injected `args' (`:owner',
;; `:reminder_id').  A handler that re-pushes derives the surface from
;; that owner; the zero-arg push is wrong here twice over.
;;
;; Bookkeeping is session-local and mirrors only what the Companion
;; CONFIRMED: the device's sets are device-lifetime durable, so an empty
;; mirror after an Emacs restart does not mean nothing is armed.
