;;; Commentary:

;; The measurement layer, ported from poc-v1 `jetpacs-devtools.el' and
;; grown a flight recorder.  Two halves, separately switched:
;;
;; PROFILER (`jetpacs-devtools-profile', OFF by default) — per-surface
;; builder wall clock, outbound push counts and serialized sizes, and
;; the push-storm tripwire for the builder-that-retriggers-itself
;; class of bug.  Timings, counts, and sizes are metadata, so SPEC
;; 23.3 does not constrain them — but sizing is not free: each push is
;; serialized once more to measure it (the same compact representation
;; as GATE 5).  It is therefore an explicit diagnostic, not daily-driver work.
;;
;; FLIGHT RECORDER (`jetpacs-devtools-recording', OFF by default) —
;; the home the scrubbed error path never had.  SPEC 23.3 makes every
;; loud channel print only the error SYMBOL (`jetpacs-error-label'):
;; the app card, *Messages*, the wire.  The morning this module was
;; born, that policy reduced a device-only home failure to the string
;; "error" with nowhere to look.  The recorder listens on the shell's
;; `jetpacs-shell-builder-error-functions' seam, which fires from
;; HANDLER-BIND context — the stack is still standing — so it can keep
;; what the label drops: the full condition, a real backtrace, and the
;; failing screen's identity, as inspectable Lisp data.  The last spec
;; each surface built rides the same setting: a spec EMBEDS payload
;; (the clip view renders the kill ring, buffer drills render buffer
;; text), so retaining one is payload capture, not metadata — it is
;; kept only while the recorder is on, and dropped with the records
;; when it turns off.
;;
;; The recorder is §23.3's "explicit developer setting" made literal:
;; detailed payload capture is legal ONLY behind such a setting, and
;; what is kept "MUST be bounded in size and lifetime" — hence off by
;; default, a hard entry cap (`jetpacs-devtools-record-limit'), and a
;; TTL (`jetpacs-devtools-record-ttl').  Nothing recorded here ever
;; crosses the wire or reaches a log; the report renders into a local
;; buffer on demand.  Enabling the recorder while a privacy-sensitive
;; trigger source (SPEC 21.4) is live is the developer's own call —
;; the setting exists so that call is explicit.
;;
;; INSPECTOR (`jetpacs-devtools-inspect', no setting at all) — the
;; third half, and the only one that answers "what is this screen
;; MADE of".  A Jetpacs screen is a Lisp datum: the builder returns a
;; spec, the spec is a plist of plists and vectors, and the device is
;; a rendering of it.  The inspector closes that loop for a human —
;; build the spec fresh, pretty-print it into a buffer, and show the
;; buffer through the Tier-0 renderer so the data is readable ON THE
;; PHONE, then hand it straight back with `jetpacs-shell-push'
;; `:spec'.  Inspect, edit the sexp, push it: the whole round trip and
;; not one line of new machinery on the return leg.
;;
;; It is CAPTURE ON DEMAND, and that is a deliberate refusal of the
;; retention above.  `jetpacs-devtools--specs' already holds a spec
;; per surface — but only while the recorder is on, which is a
;; developer setting that is OFF by default and may be off right now,
;; and what it holds is the spec of some PAST build.  Reading it would
;; make the inspector answer "nothing" on a healthy session and answer
;; STALE on a recording one.  So the inspector builds; the retention
;; is the flight recorder's business and stays that way.
;;
;; Zero wire cost for the first two: this module observes one seam and
;; two advised functions and never sends anything itself.  The
;; inspector sends exactly what any drill-in sends — a buffer.

is a question a build answers and a cache does not.

The capture route is `jetpacs-shell--build' called with the registry's
own entry plist — literally the two lines `jetpacs-shell-push' runs
before it reaches the gates.  That is the LEAST new seam available:
zero new code in the shell, and the spec you read here is the spec the
device would be sent, degrade included (a crashing builder yields its
error view rather than signalling out of an inspection).  Calling the
root's `:builder' directly would have to re-create by hand the three
things that build wraps it in — the registered owner binding, the ONE
per-document id-claim table, and the degrade — which is more new code
for a spec that is no longer the one the phone gets.  Devtools is
already the module that reaches into this function; it advises it.

The measurement is left ALONE: the profiler and the recorder are bound
off across the build, so an inspection does not land in the wall-clock
tally, does not count toward the push-storm history, and — the part
that matters under SPEC 23.3 — creates no payload retention of its own.
Inspecting is reading, not recording."

  "Pretty-print SURFACE's freshly built spec into a buffer; return it.
Nil when nothing registers SURFACE.  The buffer is
\"*jetpacs-inspect: SURFACE*\" and it OPENS WITH THE DATUM: point-min is
the spec's own open paren, so `C-M-f', `C-x C-e', and a plain kill of
the whole form all work without stepping over a preamble.  The prose —
provenance, the push-back recipe, any truncation notice — trails below
as Lisp comments.

The loop the prose describes needs no code on its return leg:

    ;; on the phone, or here
    (jetpacs-devtools-inspect \"app:hub\")
    ;; edit the sexp — retitle the top bar, drop a node, add a button
    (jetpacs-shell-push \"app:hub\" :spec EDITED)

`jetpacs-shell-push' has taken a `:spec' override since the first cut,
so the edited datum goes back exactly the way the builder's would have.
