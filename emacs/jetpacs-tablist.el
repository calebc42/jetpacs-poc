;;; jetpacs-tablist.el --- Generic tabulated-list renderer (Tier 0.5) -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Tier 0.5: `tabulated-list-mode' is a declarative UI framework — columns
;; come from `tabulated-list-format', rows carry their id and entry as text
;; properties — so ONE renderer covers every derivative (package menu,
;; process list, bookmarks, timers, and anything built on it).
;;
;; Registered as a skin for `tabulated-list-mode', so any tabulated-list
;; derivative renders as sortable cards instead of monospace text.  Row taps
;; reuse the `emacs.buffer.act' seam (push button / RET at position), so
;; activation adds no new dispatch surface; the only new wire actions are
;; `tablist.sort' and `tablist.refresh', both validated against the buffer's
;; own column format.
;;
;; Modes specialize without replacing the walk, through three hook alists
;; (header, row, filter).
;;
;; Rung JC-2 of docs/PLAN-jetpacs-consumers.md.  Ported from poc-v1 with the
;; format-6 drift applied and three conformance changes:
;;
;; - Row positions are recorded in JC-1's exposure table.  This skin builds
;;   its own rows instead of walking the Tier-0 renderer, so without that
;;   every row tap would be refused by `emacs.buffer.act''s SPEC 23.1 check.
;; - The actions derive SPEC 14.4 statuses, and `revert-buffer' is called
;;   noconfirm so it cannot prompt inside the dispatch extent (decision D2).
;; - Optional node types degrade to the Core Node Set when unadvertised
;;   (SPEC 16.2).
