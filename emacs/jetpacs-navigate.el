;;; jetpacs-navigate.el --- The buffer-view host: any buffer as a drill-in -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "30.1"))

;;; Commentary:

;; JA-2 of docs/PLAN-jetpacs-apps.md (B4): the HOST that turns "run this
;; Emacs thing" into "a rendered buffer on the originating owner's
;; surface, with a way back".  Six poc modules each hand-rolled a slice
;; of this; the host is the substrate they all port onto (JA-3's buffer
;; list is its first real consumer — deliberately NOT in this rung).
;;
;; The shape: `jetpacs-buffer-funcall-shimmed' (the new thunk primitive
;; on the renderer) captures where a thunk went; the navigator renders
;; that buffer through the `jetpacs-render-buffer' dispatch seam (skins
;; are additive: a tabulated-list target drills into JC-2 cards) and
;; hands the screen to `jetpacs-navigate-drill-function' — the chrome
;; kit's stack, decoupled by a function seam exactly like
;; `jetpacs-buffer-refresh-function', so a missing host degrades to a
;; snackbar rather than a load failure.
;;
;; D1: the target surface resolves eagerly — explicit arg, else the
;; device-flow surface (which answers both inside a handler and inside
;; a flow continuation), else the owner default.  D2: from inside a
;; handler the thunk is deferred through `jetpacs-flow-continue' (the
;; no-prompts regime holds THROUGH timers pumped inside the extent, so
;; a run-at-time dodge would not help; the flow marker also lets any
;; prompt the thunk raises bridge to the device).

answer rejected for an effect that happened); own the back affordance;
and wrap its root assembly in `jetpacs-buffer-with-budget' so the drill
body and the chrome share one SPEC 4.5 allowance.  Emit node ids
through `jetpacs-claim-node-id' — SPEC 16.1 scopes id uniqueness to the

  "Run THUNK, capture the buffer it went to, and present it.
The rewrite of the poc's view-buffer-of helper.  SURFACE resolves
EAGERLY (the dispatch extent is gone when a timer fires).  Inside an
action handler the work defers through `jetpacs-flow-continue' — the
sections.menu precedent: scheduling the presentation keeps the reply
prompt, and the flow marker lets a prompting thunk bridge — and the
handler answers its own `accepted'; elsewhere it runs synchronously.
A thunk that goes nowhere snackbars \"Nothing to show\"; a thunk error
logs and snackbars its error SYMBOL only (SPEC 23.3 — the poc
snackbarred the full message; that is not ported).

PRESENTER, when non-nil, is a function of (BUFFER POSITION SURFACE).
It receives the captured destination before the generic drill host.  A
non-nil result means it reused an existing host view, so no drill screen
is created; nil preserves the generic behavior.  The function must be
presentation-only and should return non-nil after an owned refusal too,
so a stricter host boundary cannot be bypassed by the generic fallback.
Signals are isolated and fall back to the ordinary drill.

THUNK must be UI-ONLY work: display a buffer, run a read-only command.
The handler answers `accepted' BEFORE the thunk runs, and B9 makes
`accepted' a durable commitment — a thunk that performs the event's
durable effect turns a later failure into silent loss.  Durable work
belongs in the handler (synchronous, or `jetpacs-retry-later')."
