;;; Commentary:

;; Tier 0 of Jetpacs: render ANY Emacs buffer faithfully from its text plus
;; its text/overlay properties (face, display, invisible, keymap, button,
;; mouse-face), with interactive regions made tappable.  This is the
;; universal substrate — every major mode renders through here for free, no
;; per-package translator required.  Per-mode "skins" (Tier 1) are opt-in
;; overrides registered in `jetpacs-render-buffer-functions'.
;;
;; Emacs stays the single source of truth for styling: this module resolves
;; faces to span attributes and ships them; the device only paints the
;; spans (it never re-fontifies).
;;
;; Rung JC-1 of docs/PLAN-jetpacs-consumers.md, ported from poc-v1 with the
;; format-6 span drift applied (`:bold t' -> `:font-weight "bold"'; `:code'
;; folded into `:mono'; `:strike' and `baseline' dropped — the contract has
;; neither) and two structural changes:
;;
;; - Emission is bounded by the LIVE welcome budgets, not just the line
;;   cap (plan section 2.5-5): `max_rich_spans' is spent down as the
;;   SPEC 4.5 AGGREGATE across the whole SurfaceSpec (not a per-node
;;   cap, which would sail past it), and the render stops before the
;;   node total would crowd `max_frame_bytes'.
;; - Decision D2: the two tap actions validate and return a status
;;   immediately, then run the buffer effect (which may prompt on the
;;   desktop, e.g. a widget field edit) from a `run-at-time' 0
;;   continuation — never inside the jsonrpc dispatch extent.
;;
;; The only seam back to the host is `jetpacs-buffer-refresh-function',
;; called with the originating surface id (or nil) after a tap's effect
;; runs; `jetpacs-shell' points it at `jetpacs-shell-push'.

The pop/switch family becomes `set-buffer' (faithful — their real
contract makes the buffer current).  `display-buffer' is RECORD-ONLY:
its real contract does NOT select, so a `set-buffer' shim would
silently redirect the command's own subsequent buffer-local work; it
records into `jetpacs-buffer--displayed' and returns the selected
window (a live one — callers do (select-window (display-buffer …)))."
