;;; Commentary:

;; JA-6 F1+F2 of docs/PLAN-jetpacs-apps.md: the files floor and the
;; content search.  F1 lands the effective root set (configuration plus
;; the /sdcard probe), the dired card skin with a row cap, and the three
;; browse verbs — `jetpacs.files.cd', `jetpacs.files.open',
;; `jetpacs.files.refresh'.  F2 lands `jetpacs.files.grep': a
;; `text_input' `:on-submit' on the browse screen (no dialog, no D2
;; exposure), a bounded CHUNKED scan running as a `jetpacs-async'
;; loader, and a pushed results screen — leaving the results screen
;; evicts the async entry, which CANCELS an in-flight scan; a new query
;; is a new key, so supersession and teardown both come free from the
;; async cache's sweep.  Later JA-6 phases add the five file ops, the
;; plain value+on_save editor, and the launcher.
;;
;; The security shape, stated once: RENDERING IS NOT THE BOUNDARY,
;; ACTING IS.  Cards carry raw absolute paths in `:args' because a
;; descriptor is just a description; every path that comes BACK over
;; the wire re-enters through `ebp-check-path' (the shared path guard
;; this rung and jetpacs-org both require — JA-4 audit P1-7 is why it
;; is shared), which rejects remote names before any stat, resolves
;; symlinks on both sides, and compares path components.  A dired
;; buffer for a directory outside the roots still renders — Emacs is
;; showing it, so the device may see it — but every tap on it answers
;; `rejected'.
;;
;; Two module-local bounds protect the wire and the CPU: the row cap
;; (`jetpacs-files-max-rows') bounds what one snapshot carries, and the
;; scan cap (`jetpacs-files-scan-cap') bounds how far the listing walk
;; reads at all, JC-2's bounded-scan lesson — never collect everything
;; and truncate at render.
;;
;; File names are user data: display strings pass through
;; `jetpacs-scalar-text' (an undecodable name must not make the root
;; unpushable — the JA-3 lesson), and a path that cannot round-trip the
;; wire intact renders as an INERT row rather than a tappable lie,
;; because `:args' is opaque to the shell's walkers and a raw-byte
;; string there reaches `json-serialize' and takes down the push.

hundreds of identical node plists.  The stateful search input and outer list

Files' native root and a sanctioned guest browser, and SPEC 16.1 requires each

;; The governing bound there is `max_editor_bytes' (SPEC 19, amendment
;; #84), which is larger.  So a file between the two ceilings stays on
;; the plain editor rather than losing an editor entirely.
;;

  "Open TRUE in an editor, or fall back to the read view.
Three rungs, best first: the SYNCHRONIZED SPEC 19 editor over a real
buffer, the PLAIN seed-and-save editor, and the read-only buffer host.
Runs in a flow continuation.  Returns the fallback reason symbol, or
nil when an editor screen was pushed.  A non-regular file (FIFO,
socket, device) is refused OUTRIGHT — both this read and the
fallback's `find-file-noselect' would block in open(2) forever, and
no in-process timer can interrupt that.  A PATH the wire cannot carry
byte-identically never seeds the editor either (the Commentary's
`:args' rule — the save descriptor would take the push down); the
read fallback hosts it.  A file whose CONTENT the wire cannot carry
is likewise never editable through it — the round-trip would corrupt
exactly the bytes `jetpacs-scalar-text' replaces — and a NUL marks a
binary whose \"text\" is not worth a seed.  The file's own coding is
captured off the read and stored with the seed, so the save can write
the file back in it.

MARK-POS is an optional whole-buffer position retained in the edit context
for a reader adapter, or forwarded to the plain buffer fallback.
RETURN-ACTION, when non-nil, replaces the editor's ordinary local Back
descriptor.  It is caller-authored cross-surface presentation policy: Files
stores and renders the descriptor but never interprets it.

The SIZE gate takes whichever rung reaches higher, because the two
ceilings measure different things (see the section Commentary), and a
modified desktop buffer refuses only the rungs that would LOSE its
text — the synchronized rung seeds from the buffer, so it keeps them."

;; from there.  DUPLICATE needs no prompt at all.  NEW rides a top-bar
;; button on the browse screen and prompts the same way.

MARK-POS, when non-nil for a regular file, is a whole-buffer position an
editor adapter or the read-only fallback may use as its initial scroll
target.

When BROWSER-ID is non-nil, stage Jetpacs' native browser as that chrome
screen before presenting PATH.  This is the generic cross-app handoff seam:
the caller supplies only an id and may observe the ordinary view transition;
Files still owns the browser, path policy, document host, and every file
operation.  Optional BROWSER-FAB is a typed node that explicitly adorns only
that staged browser; Files neither manufactures nor interprets it.  A
directory leaves that browser on top.  A regular file places the browser
immediately below its reader/editor, so local Back has a safe Files view even
while the caller is offline.

Optional RETURN-ACTION is an explicit cross-surface Back descriptor.  It
replaces the staged browser's ordinary local Back and, for an editable file,
the editor's Back.  Callers should supply it only when one user gesture must
leave the Files surface; nil preserves Files' native offline view switching."
